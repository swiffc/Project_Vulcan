## Core Principle

Price moves to facilitate institutional orders. Learn to read and react to smart money flow.

## Key Concepts

### Order Blocks (OB)

**Definition**: Price zones where institutional traders executed large orders. The last candle before a significant move.

**Identification**:
- Bullish OB: Last bearish candle before a strong bullish move
- Bearish OB: Last bullish candle before a strong bearish move

**Trading**:
- Use as entry zones when price returns
- Expect price reaction (bounce) at these levels
- Can also use as take-profit targets

### Fair Value Gaps (FVG)

**Definition**: Three-candle imbalance where price moved too fast, leaving an unfilled gap.

**Identification**:
- Bullish FVG: High of candle 1 doesn't touch low of candle 3 (gap between)
- Bearish FVG: Low of candle 1 doesn't touch high of candle 3

**Trading**:
- FVGs tend to get "filled" (price returns to close the gap)
- Enter on retracement to FVG
- Stop loss beyond the FVG

### Market Structure

**Break of Structure (BOS)**:
- Price breaks a previous swing high/low
- Confirms trend continuation
- Look for continuation entries after BOS

**Change of Character (CHoCH)**:
- Price shifts from HH/HL to LH/LL (or vice versa)
- Signals potential reversal
- Wait for confirmation before trading

**Market Structure Shift (MSS)**:
- Sudden displacement candle breaks internal structure
- Strong confirmation of bias change
- Often accompanied by FVG

### Kill Zones

High-probability trading windows when institutional activity peaks:

| Kill Zone | Time (UTC) | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Asian | 00:00 - 06:00 | Consolidation, range formation |
| London Open | 07:00 - 10:00 | Major moves begin, stop hunts |
| NY Open | 12:00 - 15:00 | Continuation or reversal |
| London Close | 15:00 - 17:00 | End of day moves |

**Trading Rule**: Focus on London and NY opens for highest probability setups.

### Optimal Trade Entry (OTE)

**Definition**: Sweet spot for entries after a displacement.

**Calculation**:
1. Identify a swing high and swing low
2. Apply Fibonacci retracement
3. OTE zone = 61.8% to 78.6% retracement

**Trading**:
- Wait for price to retrace to OTE after displacement
- Enter with stop beyond the swing point
- Target previous high/low or next liquidity pool

---

### Liquidity

**Types**:
- **Buyside Liquidity**: Stop losses above highs (buy stops)
- **Sellside Liquidity**: Stop losses below lows (sell stops)

**Trading**:
- Institutions hunt liquidity before real moves
- After liquidity sweep, look for reversal
- Enter after stop hunt completes
