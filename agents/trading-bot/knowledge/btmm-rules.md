# BTMM (Beat The Market Maker) Rules

Based on Steve Mauro's methodology for trading against market maker manipulation.

## Core Principle

Market makers manipulate price to trap retail traders. Identify their patterns and trade with them, not against them.

## The Three-Day Cycle

Market makers operate in predictable 3-day cycles:

### Level I - Market Maker Driven
- **Duration**: First 60 minutes of major move
- **Character**: Fast, aggressive price action
- **MM Action**: Establishing positions
- **Your Action**: WAIT - don't chase

### Level II - Retail Emotion
- **Duration**: 6-8 hours
- **Character**: Choppy, indecisive
- **MM Action**: Absent, letting retail trade emotions
- **Your Action**: WAIT or scalp small

### Level III - Market Maker Return
- **Duration**: Final push
- **Character**: Directional move with technical trend
- **MM Action**: Profit-taking, driving to targets
- **Your Action**: TRADE WITH the move

## Key Indicators

### TDI (Traders Dynamic Index)

Comprehensive indicator combining RSI, moving averages, and volatility bands.

**Components**:
- Green line: RSI
- Red line: RSI signal line
- Blue lines: Volatility bands
- Yellow line: Market baseline

**Signals**:
- **Shark Fin**: Sharp RSI spike followed by reversal = entry signal
- **Cross Up**: Green crosses above red = bullish
- **Cross Down**: Green crosses below red = bearish
- **Overbought**: Green above 68 = potential reversal
- **Oversold**: Green below 32 = potential reversal

## Session-Based Trading

- Mark the range (high and low)
- Set up for London breakout

### London Session (07:00 - 16:00 UTC)
- Major moves begin
- Trade breakout from Asian range
- Watch for stop hunts at session open

### New York Session (12:00 - 21:00 UTC)

- Watch for reversal at 15:00-17:00 UTC
- End of day positioning

## Stop Hunt Strategy

**What MMs Do**:
1. Push price to key support/resistance
2. Trigger retail stop losses
3. Accumulate positions at better prices
4. Reverse and run in true direction

**Your Response**:
1. Identify likely stop hunt levels (equal highs/lows)
2. Wait for the sweep
3. Enter after reversal confirmation
4. Ride with the market makers

## Trading the Gap
