# Quarterly Theory

Time-based market cycle analysis applicable across all timeframes.

## Core Principle

Markets move in fractal, time-driven cycles. The same AMDX pattern repeats across yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, and intraday timeframes.

---

## The AMDX Model

Four phases that repeat at every scale:

### Q1 - Accumulation
- **Character**: Consolidation, low volatility
- **Action**: Smart money building positions
- **Trading**: Prepare, don't trade yet
- **Duration**: 25% of cycle

### Q2 - Manipulation (Judas Swing)
- **Character**: False move, the "trap"
- **Action**: Retail lured into wrong direction
- **Trading**: Wait for reversal signals
- **Duration**: 25% of cycle

### Q3 - Distribution
- **Character**: Main move, high volatility
- **Action**: Smart money distributing profits
- **Trading**: PRIMARY TRADING WINDOW
- **Duration**: 25% of cycle

### Q4 - Continuation/Reversal (X)
- **Character**: Trend decision point
- **Action**: Either continue or reverse
- **Trading**: Take profits, prepare for next cycle
- **Duration**: 25% of cycle

## Multi-Timeframe Application

### Yearly Quarters

| Quarter | Months | Phase |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Q1 | Jan-Mar | Accumulation |
| Q2 | Apr-Jun | Manipulation |
| Q3 | Jul-Sep | Distribution |
| Q4 | Oct-Dec | X (Decision) |

**True Open**: April open serves as yearly reference point.

---

### Monthly Quarters

Each month divided into ~4 weeks:
- Week 1: Accumulation
- Week 2: Manipulation
- Week 3: Distribution
- Week 4: X

---

### Weekly Quarters

| Day | Phase | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|
| Monday | Q1 - Accumulation | Range-finding day |
| Tuesday | Q2 - Manipulation | Judas swing likely |
| Wednesday | Q3 - Distribution | MAIN TRADING DAY |
| Thursday | Q4 - X | Continuation or reversal |
| Friday | N/A | Profit-taking, avoid |

**True Open**: Tuesday open serves as weekly reference.

---

### Daily Quarters (Sessions)

| Session | Time (UTC) | Phase |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Asian | 00:00 - 06:00 | Q1 - Accumulation |
| London | 06:00 - 12:00 | Q2 - Manipulation |
| NY AM | 12:00 - 18:00 | Q3 - Distribution |
| NY PM | 18:00 - 00:00 | Q4 - X |

**True Open**: London session open (06:00-07:00 UTC)

---

### 90-Minute Quarters

Each major session = 6 hours = Four 90-minute quarters

| Quarter | Duration | Notes |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Q1 | First 90 min | Setup phase |
| Q2 | Second 90 min | Manipulation |
| Q3 | Third 90 min | Main move |
| Q4 | Fourth 90 min | Close of session |

---

## The True Open Concept

**Definition**: The actual starting point of a cycle, typically at Q2.

**Usage**:
- Price above True Open = Bullish bias
- Price below True Open = Bearish bias

**Reference Points**:
- Yearly True Open: April 1st open
- Weekly True Open: Tuesday 00:00 UTC
- Daily True Open: London open (07:00 UTC)

## Trading Application

### Best Times to Trade

1. **Q2-Q3 Transition**: After manipulation, catch the main move
2. **Wednesday**: Primary distribution day of the week
3. **London-NY Overlap**: 12:00-15:00 UTC

### Setup Process

1. Identify current position in cycle (which Q?)
2. Note True Open price
3. Wait for Q2 manipulation (false move)
4. Enter on Q3 initiation
5. Exit before Q4 or on reversal signs
