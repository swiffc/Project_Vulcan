- **Note**: "FOR NON-STANDARD MOVEMENT USE: TOTAL MOVEMENT +1/16"
- **Requirement**: Check angle size for adequacy

---

## Dimensions and Clearances

### Frame to Header

- **Clearance**: 1" between frame and header

### Anchor Pad Placement

- **Distance from Header**: 2"
- **Placement**: Anchor pad positioned 2" from header

### Tie-Down Bar Placement

- Positioned between header and anchor pad
- Dimensions: 2" x 1" x 2"

## Installation Details

### Assembly Components

1. **Frame**: L 3 x 3 x 1/2 x 0'-6 1/2 (B701)
   - With 2 - 3/4" diameter x 2" Grade (HS) bolts and nuts with flat washers

2. **Anchor Pad**: L 3 x 3 x 1/2 x 0'-6 (B703)
   - With 2 - 3/4" diameter x 2" Grade (HS) bolts and nuts with flat washers

3. **Tie-Down Bar**: 2" x 1" x 0'-2 (W615)

### Movement Allowance

1. **Standard Installation**:
   - Allow 5/8" total movement
   - Use standard angle size

2. **Non-Standard Installation**:
   - Calculate: Total movement + 1/16"
   - Check angle size for adequacy
   - Verify dimensions meet requirements

### Anchor Bolt Plans

**Drawing Reference**: 11 S02 (Anchor Bolt Plan)

**Requirements**:
- Anchor Bolt Plans are provided for all winterized units without floors
- All column centerlines and anchor bolts requirements are located on the Anchor Bolt Plan
- Details of column base plate, ladder base shown on Anchor Bolt Plan when space permits
- If space doesn't permit, details shown on plan/plan of plenum

**Drawing Sequence**:
- Anchor Bolt plan is the second General Arrangement drawing if KEY PLAN is required
- Listed as drawing 11 A 1
- If no Key Plan is required, then Anchor Bolt Plan is listed as drawing 11 A 1
- If both Key Plan and Anchor Bolt Plan are not required, then first GA drawing is listed as drawing 11 A 1

### Foundation Notes

**Standard Note**: "FOUNDATION AND ANCHOR BOLTS: HPC standard note is TO BE PROVIDED BY OTHERS"

## Integration Notes

### For CAD Validation

When validating tie-down and anchor details:

1. ✅ **Standard Parts**: Verify correct part numbers (B701, B703, W615, W618)
2. ✅ **Dimensions**: Check angle sizes and bar dimensions match specifications
3. ✅ **Fasteners**: Verify 3/4" diameter x 2" Grade (HS) bolts with nuts and flat washers
4. ✅ **Movement**: Check movement allowance (5/8" standard or calculated for non-standard)
5. ✅ **Clearances**: Verify 1" clearance between frame and header
6. ✅ **Placement**: Check anchor pad 2" from header

### For Design Recommender

When recommending tie-down and anchor details:

1. **Use Standard Parts**: B701, B703, W615, W618
2. **Calculate Movement**: Determine if standard (5/8") or non-standard (total movement + 1/16")
3. **Check Angle Size**: Verify angle size adequate for movement requirements
4. **Specify Fasteners**: 3/4" diameter x 2" Grade (HS) bolts, nuts, flat washers

## Notes

- Bolt and flange not shown for clarity in front view drawings
- Standard part B703 was created specifically for header anchor pad
- Movement requirements must be checked for each application
- Anchor bolt plans are separate from tie-down details (for foundation anchors)
