HPC Walkway Standards : February 11,2005
Attached are the revised walkway standards. Please discard the current walkway standards from your Standard Book II,
Vol. II, Section 6 and replace with the attached package. The revised standards are effective immediately on jobs where
the walkway details have not been detailed.
The attached package contains a 4-page write-up, Standard Drawings 8SDl through 8SD9A (23 forms), and Example
Drawings 8EXl through 8EX7 (8 forms). The revisions to the HPC Walkway Standards consist of the following:
a) Restructured information - information on the standard drawings was restructured onto new and/or existing drawings
using our current drawing application. The majority of standard information is now provided on letter-sized forms in
lieu of the Ilxl7 forms; in some cases only the drawing format was revised. No walkway standard information was
deleted; information in general was amended and brought up to date per current practices and documentation.
b) Removed bill of material- the Bill of Material (BOM) information was removed from all Example Drawings in
order to avoid conflicting with other BOM documentation and/or practices.
c) New toe-plate design -the toe-plate design is now a PRL 4 1I2"x 2"x 114" welded component in lieu of the l/4"x 4
112" flat bar. New standard parts and assemblies have been created per this new design and are now available for
use. The new standard part num bers are noted as W88__ or 88A__ (current parts are noted as W8__ or 8A__, e.g.,
part W880 1R and assembly 88A09 are used with the new PRL toe-plate and W80 IRand 8A09 are used with the old
FB toe-plate)
d) New detailing method - the handrails will now be detailed in a plan-view detailing method. The handrail sections
will be detailed in plan-view using single line detailing with view sections placed along the top border. Example
Drawing 8EX3 contains samples of details and views.
Please discard the current walkway standard package in Section 6 and replace with the attached package. If you have any
questions or comments concerning standard parts contact John Galvan at ext. 8138 or contact me at ext. 8325.

Issuance of Series Sheets & Parts List Procedure, Revision 2 I DATXUgust 10, 1999
Attached is revision 2 to the Series Sheets and Parts List Procedure.
Please discard your old procedure and add the enclosed document to Section 7C, of Standard Book II, Vol.
II. If you were not issued Standard Book II, it is your responsibility to maintain this procedure.
The latest revisions to this standard consist of:
1. Addition of two Mechanical Parts Reference sheets to Appendix C.
2. Revision of bolt connection forms to accommodate both the piece mark and description; in the past
there was difficulty in fitting piece marks in the designated cell.
I reiterate to always use a master forms from the PL MASTERS folder and to use numerical 1 in place of
the word ONE on these documents.
If your interest is in retrieving Parts List information from the files on the server, then pages 1-12 will
provide you with information to understand the file name, folder structuring and locations. In particular,
page 6 illustration provides you with the path to the final destination of issued Series Sheets and Parts List,
the CheckedJSSUED folder. However, it would be very beneficial to read the complete procedure to get a
full understanding ofthe Parts List structure.

PLAN BRACE
Working point location:
A. Side panel
To locate working points, first find the 1/3 point on the side panel (refer to drawings
PLAN-I for forced draft, PLAN-2 for forced draft, multi-bundle, & PLAN-3 for
Johnson Units). Dimension "A" is from the inside of the end panel to the center of the
center panel for single bundle units and from the center of multi-bundle support beam
to the center of center panel for multi-bundle units. The maximum "AI ", is 5'-6. Note:
if dimension "A2" is greater than 5'-6 a horizontal panel reinforcing angle will be
required.
B. End and center panel
Dimension "B I " will be the same as "AI" unless "B2" becomes less than 3" inches.
Note that if dimension "B2" is less than 3 inches, increase "B2". In this case, the plan
brace can not be at a 45° angle. Therefore, it will be "as shown" and "opp. hand".
If stiffener is required at the center of the end panel, the minimum "B2" is 6 inches.
C. Beam and center panel (multi-bundle units)
Dimension "BI"will bethe same as "AI" unless "B2" becomes less than 3" inches.
Note that if dimension "B2" is less than 3 inches, increase "B2". In this case, the plan
brace can not be at a 45° angle. Therefore, it will be "as shown" and "opp. hand".
For detailing information see drawings PLAN-I and PLAN-2.

INTRODUCTION
(~l
PRISM is an acronym that stands for Proposal Integration System Manager. An
information system that shares work performed by the Rating and Proposal departments
with the Engineering department. This documentation introduces you to the Header
Design Module.
The Header Design Module provides an environment to design a header for air
cooled heat exchangers (ACHE). The module stores and retrieves design parameters from a
central database to assist in executing the header program. There are report capabilities to
document the design. For.example, the Standard Bundle Worksheet is generated within
this environment. To produce this drawing, the system accesses the job specification sheet
and the header design criteria. 1

(
Getting started:
1.) Select the Job/Proposal button. This will
bring up a dialog box for you to enter the
Job or Proposal number.
2) Press the Item Selection button. A pop
up menu will display all the associated
items. Select the item or choose Cancel.
The screen will display the customer name
and the service for that Item. If the query
can not find your entry. Contact the Help j
desk for assistance.
This is the main Header Design Screen.
f
Header Configurations:
The Item Headers button leads you to a new screen (shown on the next page). This is where
you will build the Item header configuration. The congifuarion is determined by a
combination of the number of passes, number of rows, and the customer specifications.

Introduction to Report Generation:
... __ _ The header designer prepares several reports and drawings to support the
~o:mation~bout bU~dle
• ACHE design. To process these reports, more the
-- must be confrrrned. Spec Sheet and header design mformation are proVlded by
the central database, but other design options you need to acknowledge. Please note
information is read only from the central database. If you find an invalid value, only the
appropriate department can correct the value (ie sales, rating, header design, etc). And for
now, the design parameters you select are not saved anywhere. In other words, you will
always be required to supply and get information to generate a drawing or report.
The Bundle Type section refers to the physical contruction and lay-out. The buttons in the
Bundle Design Information section lead you other screens that display futher details and
options about the item. You will not be able to generate the drawing or report until each
design information screen is reviewed. The next few pages discuss the design information
screens. The report and drawing sections follow.

VersaCAD & Standard Bundle WorkSheet:
W.AR
The VersaCAD application has an added menu bar title named IISBW. DWG". The
~ menu items are specific routines to assist you in etliting or modifying the
. Standard Bundle Worksheet (SBW) drawing. To take advantage of these tools,
the drawing must be generated by the PRISM Header Design Module version 3.0 or better. ···1
The next few page will discuss each tool and the associative dimensioning feature. I
To print a SBW drawing to the LaserWriter first select Plot SetUp from the File menu. Then
press the Specs button and highlite Laser. Press the Get button and then press Ok. Next
select Plot from the File menu and the press Ok button. Note: To use the Laser Plot SetUp
the drawing must be in the full window position.
The SBW drawing is level sensitive. You are welcomed to add any object to level one. To
change or delete an object on other levels, you will need to unlock the level. To unlock a
level, select Levels under the Settings menu. Highlite the level and choose unlock, then
press the Ok button. See appendix A for a complete list of all levels and names.

L Dimension Palette:
The Dimension Palette menu item opens a movable dialog box. Since most dimensions on
[ saw
the drawing are linked to one another. VersaCAD neeeds a way to acknowlege a
dimension change. This is done through the dimension dialog box shown above. When you
select a text object, the palette changes to let you know that the text is a key dimension, and
II
if there are associative dimensions (see examples above). Click on the revision icon to bring
up the dimension dialog box. Here you can change the dimension and you have a choice to
update any associative dimensions.

5.0 INSTRUCTIONS
5.1 Frame component requirements are determined by the Structural Engineer and displayed on
the Design/Drafting Checklist. The following table gives an overview (use with TBF
illustration drawing ILL 1) of tube bundle frame components:
Lifting Lug • 2 per frame channel.
Header Pad • 4 per frame, although, pad size may differ for each header (based
on inlet/outlet or nozzle/return bundle configuration).
• Split headers with large gaps between headers may require one set
of header pads for each individual header.
I.
Center Spacer 1 required for 2-fan induced draft unit.
• None required for I-fan units.
• Ifforced draft unit requiring a stack with hood, than one spacer
required based on induced draft unit design/drafting standard.
End Spacer • 4 per unit; one at the top and bottom ofeach end.
• Bottom end spacer on induced draft shaft-thru units will require a
shaft-thru seal support.
"D" • Located at top of frame for all induced draft units and
for forced draft units with attachments to top of frame.
series
• Located at bottom offrame for all forced draft units,
(exception: with steam coil), and for induced draft units
with attachments to the bottom of frame.
"E" • Located at top of frame for forced draft unit without
attachments to top of frame.
series
• Located at bottom of frame for induced draft unit
without attachments to bottom of frame.
"F" • Located at top of frame for all bundle with large inlet
nozzles that may interfere with the end spacer location.
series
• Located at bottom of frame for forced or induced draft

Notes:
1. Always use lock bars when possible.
2. Use position strips when tube length is 24'-0 and less.
3. Do not use positioners at spacer if tubes above or below are retained by one or more positioners.
4. When rms are crushed, tube positioners are considered retained.
5. When rms are not crushed, tube positioners are to be retained by a minimum of 2 stainless steel wires or other means.
6. Material available for positioning tubes:
6.1. Aluminum
Lock bars Position strips
1/2 x 1 (39522) 1/8 x 2 (39517)
1/4 x 2 (39520)
6.2. Steel
Flat bars Pressed C Pressed [
1/8 x 2 13/16(thru2 15/16) x 2 x 10GA. 3(andabove) x 2 x 10GA.
1/4 x 2
3/8 x 2
1/2 x 2
5/8 x 2
3/4 x 2
7. For vertical dimensions greater than charted and when tubes are not retained above or below then any of the
following methods can be used.
7.1. Position strip or lock bar attached to a 2" wide flat bar, pressed C or pressed [
7.2. Combination of position strip and/or lock bars (method not preferred)
,
7.3. Crush rms 1/16" instead of 1/8".
8. Horizontal dimensions of available die for forming tube positioners: 2, 2 1/16, 2 1/8, 23/16, 2 1/4, 25/16, 23/8
2 13/32, 27/16, 2 1/2, 29/16, 25/8, 23/4, 27/8, 3, 3 1/8, 3 1/4, 35/16, 33/8, 3 1/2, 39/16,

STD BOOK II, VOL, II, TBF Diverter and Position Strip Retainer Standards SECT 5B, 7REF66
The TBF side air seal system has been replaced with a diverter/retainer system. The diverter/retainer system consists ofthree major components:
angles placed between tube-keepers; 12 GA bent sheet retainers tack-welded to side channel; and 3"-long angle header stop behind header boxes. The
following information outlines the detailing and designing standards for the new TBF diverters and position strip retainers.
Diverters: Position Strip Retainers:
I. Selection of standard diverter angle is based on tube support I. The length of retainer coverage is determined by multiplying the
spacing and header type. The angles are 2 l/2x2 l/2x3/16 for vertical tube pitch and the number ofspaces between the
plug headers and 3x2 l/2x3/16 for cover-plate headers. outermost rows oftubes. Any combination of standard lengths
(see standard drawing W727 and spreadsheet) is used to meet
2. Center-diverters are located between tube keepers according to
the coverage (see left image below).

3.1.3 All ofthese files are stored electronically on the server in the Standards and Procedure
folder.
3.2 Walkway information is to be obtained from the FFSS, General Arrangements drawings, Unit
Assembly drawings, and the customer's job specifications.
3.3 Walkway piece marks on the walkway details should correspond to the Unit Assembly drawings.
3.4 Use the 8SD drawings to design the platforms and locate handrails and ladders relative to the
substructure.
3.5 Title block
3.5.1 The title block is to be completed for each drawing by the detailer.
3.5.2 The title ofeach drawing is to be "WALKWAY DETAILS".
3.5.3 The item number(s) should apply to each drawing from the sheet numbers.
3.5.4 Fill in bank identification(s) which apply to each drawing from the sheet numbers and/or
General Arrangement drawings.
3.5.5 The customer's name, plant location, purchase order number and job number are to be the
same as all other job drawings and correspond with the General Arrangement drawings.
3.6 General notes
3.6.1 Attached drawings show HPC walkway plan views for standard forced draft 3-point
supports, forced draft 2-point supports, forced draft Johnson Design units, and induced
draft 2-point supports.
3.6.2 Fabrication standards for these walkway components apply to both painted and
galvanized job. This information is applicable to all walkway standard drawings.
3.7 Walkways should be designed using standard parts and assemblies as much as possible so that the
number of detailed components is minimal and bill of material is kept to one bill. Component
placement on drawing should be organized such that the number of drawings is minimal.
3.8 Bill of Material - The bill of materials should conform to standards outlined in Standard Book I.
3.9 Platforms
3.9.1 Design - 50 lbs per square foot or a moving concentrated load of 500 lbs per API 661. For
*
additional platform designs see Table 3. Strut spacing denoted with an requires
supporting the floor plate with a strut. For bolted floor plate splices use a L5" x 3" x 1/4"
strut in place ofthe L2 1/2" x 2 1/2" x 1/4".

3.9.2 Fabrication - welded assemblies to have maximum length of29'-0 when possible for
handling and shipping.
3.9.3 Grating - designed to 100 Ibs per square foot (API 661). Material is N.A.A.M.M.
designation W-19-4- (l" x 3/16" steel) and is held in place with Borden type F-9 clips
with self-tapping screws or equal.
3.9.4 Floor plate- designed to 100 Ibs persquare foot (API 661), with maximum span of3'-6.
One 9/16" diameter drain hole, located near center, is required on each plate. Material is
a minimum of 1/4" thick floor plate with raised pattern.
3.10 Handrails
3.10.1 Design - maximum post spacing is 6'-8 (reference OSHA D1910.23e and API 661).
Member sizes for rails and posts are 2 1/2" x 2 1/2" x 1/4" angles; welded toe plates are
pressed angle 4 1/2" x 2" x 1/4".
3.10.2 The handrail assembly takes precedence over platforms when determining the detailing
of several similar pieces.
3.10.3 Handrails are provided along both sides and at any open end of a platform.
3.10.4 The vertical tail dimensions are included when detailing non-standard handrail posts.
3.11 Ladders
3.11.1 Design - moving concentrated load of 500 Ibs (API 661) with maximum length of 30 feet
(OSHA, 29 CFR CH. XVII paragraph 1910.27, 7/1/94 Edition).
3.11.2. Use the SD series drawings to determine ladder positions, see EX drawings for reference.
3.11.3 HPC ladders consist oftwo types, side-step and step-thru. The side-step ladder is the
HPC standard; the step-thru ladder is used when required by customer specifications or
special conditions. Both ladder types can originate from grade to platform or from
platform to platform.
3.11.4 Ladder base plates are required on all ladders that are grade mounted or ladders mounted
to top ofa platform. Field bolts (5/8" diameter) are required to bolt the base plate to the
grating or floor plate.
3.12 Gates
3.12.1 Safety gates are required at all handrail openings serving as ladder exits. HPC standard
gate is the Intrepid safety gate.

3.12.2 Gates requiring detailing should be placed on the ladder detail drawing.
4.0 DETAILING REVISION
4.1 All changes, after issuance, will be documented as revisions by having the latest revision triangles
placed in the vicinity of the revision.
4.2 One revision triangle in the general vicinity of revisions is sufficient for high numbers of revisions.
4.3 In cases where the whole drawing is revised, no revision triangle is needed, but clearly define the
revision in the revision comment box.
4.4 The job stick file is to be checked for additional revisions.
4.5 The detailer should add initials, revision comments, and the date to the revision block after
completing the revisions.
4.6 Approval initials should be added by the detailer after the drawing has been checked.

6.1 Before making any revisions, the hard copy in the hanging file should be removed and
voided.
6.2 Drafting will retrieve the original file from the CAD Server and rename the file by adding
"-R" plus the required revision number to the name. Example: G400-Cl to be renamed to
G400-C l-Rl for revision 1.
6.3 Changes to the C1 do not need to be documented as a revision unless the previous version
was issued.
6.4 All necessary changes are noted with revision triangles. These exist in the Excel file
"revision triangles" in:

Parts List.
The Parts List is a compilation of Series Sheets issued as a document upon completion ofthe
Assembly drawings (10's). To create the Parts List, the Series Sheets are organized with
additional documents and assigned a page sequence. Refer to these documents as Parts List
pages, documents or sheets, and not Series Sheets.
This section will define and discuss the managing of the Parts List electronic files. Topics will
cover file nomenclature, file management, document sequence, file hierarchy, revision control,
and Series Sheets transition to Parts List.
4.1 File Nomenclature
4.1.1 This section provides clarification of the job file nomenclature for all Parts List
document files. For this procedure, job H595 Parts List electronic files were
modified and used as the example Parts List.
4.1.2 Parts List Files
All Parts List files are constructed in the following format: XOOO PLO 0-0

4.1.2.1 Underscores, -' separate each of the three characters of the
nomenclature.
4.1.2.2 All file nomenclature begins with the job number, e.g., XOOO. X
represents the alphabetical job series and 000 represents the job
number.
4.1.2.3 The Parts List acronym, PL is the second file character. The number, 1,
accompanying the acronym designates the bank. If more than one
bank, the number sequentially increases.
4.1.2.4 The third file character, 3-1, or USL-l, pertains to the Series Sheet.
The first number or acronym designates the drawing series, e.g. 3 for
panels and plenums, USL for Unit Shipping List, etc. The second
number, 1, designates the sheet number for that Series Sheet. If more
than one sheet, the number sequentially increases. The hyphen ties the
two numbers together, while distinguishing them from other file
nomenclature characters.
4.1.3 Approved Parts List and Series Sheet Acronyms
4.1.3.1 The following acronyms are the only nomenclatures approved for use
on the Parts List and Series Sheets. The sheet number increases
sequentially as required.
CS-l Cover Sheet 2-1 Doors
USL-l Unit Shipping List 3-1 Panels or Plenums
MP-l Mechanical Parts 23-1 Panels (field items)

4.2 File Management
In this section the job folder hierarchy will be explained and illustrated. This section will
also outline file management responsibilities.
4.2.1 Job Folder Hierarchy
The job folder hierarchy is configured so that each job has a job folder
containing a Parts List folder for each bank. In the first H595 example, there are
two folders one for the first bank, H595ylJ, and another for the second bank,
H595y12. Within each bank Parts List folder are the documents for that
particular Parts List. The example, H595ylJ, contains the Parts List documents
for bank A. All Series Sheet and Parts List files will be maintained in a
XOOOy/# folder, regardless oftheir status.

This job folder hierarchy system is the method used for managing Parts List
documents. All documents in progress will be located in the PARTS LIST IN
PROGRESS transfer folder. Therefore, when starting a Series Sheet begin by
creating a job folder in the PARTS LIST IN PROGRESS folder. Then create the
Parts List bank folders, HOOOyll, HOOOy12, etc., within the job folder.
4.2.2 File Maintenance Responsibilities
All daily work is to be placed in the Network Backup folder located on your
desktop at the end of each day; this is not an optional procedure step. File
maintenance responsibility begins at the lowest level of the job hierarchy. This
means that the start of maintaining accountability belongs to the creator of the
Series Sheets.
4.2.2.1 Server Documents Administrator is responsible for:
a. Creating job folder hierarchy.
b. Managing job files between the TO_BE_MOVED and
Checked ISSUED folders.
4.2.2.2 Detailer is responsible for:
a. Maintaining file folders in the PARTS LIST IN PROGRESS folder
in the prescribed manner.
b. Naming the document files.
c. Completing the documents electronically, and from the server.
d. Dating and initialing all documents.
e. Copying the job folder (e.g., HOOOyll and HOOOy12) with all the
document files onto the Checked ISSUED, once the document has
been checked, scrubbed and approved.
If no job folder exist in the CheckedJSSUED folder, still move
the job folder.
If a p/# folder exist, only move the file(s) into the existing p/#
folder.

4.5 Revision Control
All revisions will be done on the original document file. The revision process will entail
retrieving the latest document file, creating a new worksheet, renaming the worksheet tab,
and completing the revision on the new worksheet.
4.5.1 Begin by creating the job folder hierarchy in the transfer folder, if necessary.
4.5.2 Retrieve the document file from the job folder located at:
Q:\HPC_CAD_SERVER\ HPC_CAD_JOBS \ Check_ISSUED \HOOO_JOBS\HOOO\HOOO_PLl
Ifthe latest worksheet is not in the Checked_ISSUED folder, the only other place
it should be is in the TO BE MOVED folder located at:
Q:\HPC_CAD_SERVER\ HPC_CAD_JOBS\TRANSFERS\Sam\TO_BE_MOVED\HOOO_PLl
4.5.2.1 Copy the file into the PARTS LISTINPROGRESS transfer folder by one
of two methods. Use the previous Copy and laste instructions. Or,
Qpen (or double click) the document, then Save As... into the proper
job folder in the PARTS LIST IN PROGRESS transfer folder,
maintaining the document name ifpossible.
4.5.2.2 Ifrevising a Series Sheet or Parts List document created prior to this
procedure, rename the file per the new nomenclature and the tab to
whatever revision the worksheet is. Then, copy the worksheet and
rename the tab to the current revision.
4.5.2.3 If the worksheet is an RPM file, where the 25's and 28's are together,
use the following instructions to update the file:
4.5.2.3.1 Qpen the RPM file, Save As... into the appropriate PARTS
LISTIN PROGRESS folder with the file name format
X### PL# 28-#.
- -
4.5.2.3.2 Do another Save As... and name this file X### PL# 25-#.
You should still have the X###_PL#_25-# documenCopened;
the tabs at the bottom ofthe worksheet read 25's and 28's.

4.5.4 Renaming the worksheet
A new worksheet has now been created. The worksheet default name is shown in
the tab at the bottom of the document, RO(2). There are two methods to renaming
worksheets, both will highlight the tab name allowing you to type in the new
revision number.
4.5.4.1 Double left mouse click on the tab to be renamed, then type in the new
name.
4.5.4.2 Or, place the cursor over the tab to be renamed and right click. A menu
will appear, left mouse click the Rename option.
When creating revisions make sure that the worksheet you are working on is the
latest one. The clear tab indicates the activated worksheet. In the example, the RI
tab is the clear tab as opposed to the shaded RO tab, indicating worksheet RI is the
activated worksheet. Activate the worksheet to ~ave it.
4.5.5 Revising the Parts List
4.5.5.1 Always revise the Parts List cover sheet and issue with the revised
individual pages. The cover sheet revision description will read similarly
to the example below.

4.5.5.2 The revision description for other Parts List pages should read as in the
example below.
4.5.5.3 Maintain the R# tab fonnat and remove all revision notes and marks.
4.6 Series Sheet Transition to Parts List
This section will provide instructions for maintaining Series Sheet history when preparing
the Parts List.
4.6.1 This process dictates that the latest Series Sheet revision be copied for the first
issuance ofthe Parts List (RO is the first issuance).
4.6.2 Rename all previous Series Sheet worksheets with S#; S indicating Series Sheet
and # designated the revision number for that Series Sheet (e.g., a Series Sheet
worksheet with four revisions tabs, R4, R3, R2, RI, RO will be renamed S4, S3,
S2, S1, and SO).
4.6.3 To transfer the Series Sheets to the Parts List:
4.6.3.1 Open the file document from the Checked_ISSUED folder.
4.6.3.2 Save As the file to the appropriate PARTS LIST INPROGRESS folder.
4.6.3.3 Rename the Series Sheet worksheet tabs per the S# fonnat. Ifchanges
affect the Series Sheet, revise the Series Sheet document, save with the
current S# revision and then proceed with the transition into the Parts
List.
4.6.3.4 Now create a new worksheet ofthe latest Series Sheet revision
worksheet using the Make or Copy ... command.
4.6.3.5 Rename the new worksheet default tab name to RO. This RO worksheet
is the first issuance ofthe Parts List document.
4.6.3.6 At this point there should be, at the least, one SO and one RO worksheet;
most likely there are several S# worksheets and one RO worksheet.
4.6.3.7 You are creating the Parts List from the Series Sheets, therefore replace
the Series Sheet initials and dates with your initials and current date.

The font, font size, and alignment are assigned and locked in these cells.
• When entering the SERIES leave a blank space before the text (e.g., " 3-1 ").
Because of the way MS Excel interprets numbers, the information will not be
properly displayed without the space.
• Whenever a cell for BANK, COLOR CODE, ITEM NO., or revision data is to
be left blank, leave a blank space in the cell. Do not merely delete the cell's
contents. This may affect the text alignment.
• Separate HPC fabricated and non-HPC fabricated part onto separate Series
