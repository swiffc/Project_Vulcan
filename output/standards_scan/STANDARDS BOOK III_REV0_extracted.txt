STD. Bk. III, Sections 1 through 8 Replacement page 2 of2 November 20,2001
Particular revision changes are listed below:
1) All documents were re-formatted to include file name, proprietary note, and approval signature. On some
documents the arrangement ofthe contents was revised with no changes to the actual contents themselves;
these changes will not be itemized below.
2) The Table ofContents was revised to reflect the book sections rather than the book contents and an
individual table ofcontents was added to each section.
3) Section 1: Weld Metal Calculations documentation and Weld Metal Estimate Worksheets were added, and
the pagination was revised.
4) Section 2 was subdivided into Sections A and B, with A pertaining to plug header design and B pertaining
to cover plate header designs. The Plug Header document was revised to clarify the 3/8" clearance
between the plug hole edge to end/plug/tube plates. Plug torque tables were added to Section A.
5) Section 3: page 9, Transition Material Dimensions does not have an approval signature because the
information on the shortest possible transition lengths is pending. The released information is based on
HPC's long standing practices; length variance may occur at the Header Designer's discretion.
6) Section 4: the Tube Positioner Guidelines document was revised to reflect the combination use of 1/8" and
1/4" thick position strips for 3/8" thick position strip requirements. The tube count charts were converted
from an old application into our current AutoCAD® application.
7) Section 6: the Run-OffTab Material document was revised to reflect the run-off tab dimensions of3" wide
x 3" long. The Slide Pad Information document was revised to reflect the current HPC standard use of
stainless steel plate. The slide pad and plate part numbers were also added to the information. The
pagination was revised.
8) Section 7: the Steam Coil Dimensions document was revised to include data for I" tubes @ 3 3/8" clc &
5/8" fins. HPC standard remains 1" tubes @ 4 W' clc & 5/8" fins.
9) Section 8: the HPC Specification PL-2 document was re-formatted and increased from a single page to
two pages. The Material Density Chart was revised to include data for copper material. The pagination
was revised.

WELD METAL CALCULATIONS
1.0 This document describes how to calculate the weld metals required in each job. The detailed
procedures are as follows:
2.0 With regard to the calculations of weld metals for carbon steel and stainless steel (Types
304/304L, 316/316L, 347) headers and steam coils, the electronic files can be found on the server
in Volume 2, drive Q: Vol2 on "Hpchousrdc02" (Q:)\Shared Hdesign\Weld Metal\.
2.1 The file names are:
2.1.1 WELDMETAL(-20).xls for carbon steel headers with MDMT at -20 Deg. F or
higher.
2.1.2 WELDMETAL(-50).xls for carbon steel headers with MDMT between -50 Deg. F
and -20 Deg.F.
2.1.3 WELDMETAL-SS.xls for stainless steel headers (Types 304/304L, 316/316L,
347).
2.1.4 WELDSTEAMCOIL.xls for steam coils.
3.0 Data Input:
3.1 Enter Job Number, Item Number, Bundle Quantities or Steam Coil Quantities and the
Engineering Weight that came from Header Weight Calculation Sheet.
3.2 Results: Total Weld Metal Weight per Part Number.
4.0 The header designer is responsible for inputting required weld metal part numbers and their weight
to the Visibility as per the quantities calculated from Weld Metal Weight Sheet.
5.0 With regard to the calculations of weld metals for materials other than those mentioned above, the
header designer should send the complete header design and Bill of Materials to a weld engineer
for calculations. After the calculations are finished, the weld engineer will be responsible for
sending the results back to the header designer. Then, the header designer is in charge of inputting
required weld metal part numbers and their weight to the Visibility as per the quantities calculated
from Weld Metal Weight Sheet.

HEADER LENGTH GUIDELINES
1.0 Calculating minimum required header length.
1.1 Same number oftubes per row:
HDR LENGTII = ([(No. tubes - 1) + 1/2] x Horizontal pitch) + tube OD + 2 x [1/4" min rolled or
3/8" min welded] + 2 x (end plates)
1.2 Alternating number oftubes perrow: use the row with the largestnumber oftubes.
HDR LENGTII = (No. tubes - 1) x Horizontal pitch + Tube OD + 2x [1/4" min rolled or 3/8" min
welded] + 2x (end plates)
2.0 Calculating maximum header length based on header movement and bundle frame width.
HDR LENGTII = Bundle Frame Width -2· [Frame thickness (5/16" std) + Distance between frame
and weld crown (1/2 movement = 5/16" std) + Weld Crown (1/8")] = Bundle
Frame Width - 1 1/2" (For std movement of 5/8" total with std frame thickness
of 5/16")
3.0 If the minimum required header length is GREATER than the header length based on
header movement, then one ofthe following must be performed:
3.1 Flare the tube bundle frame.
3.2 Prepare a window in the side ofthe frame.
3.3 Decrease the number of tubes, if rating permits.
3.4 Increase the bundle width, ifstructure layout permits.

1.0 Open spreadsheet named: PLUGTORQUE R2.xls, which is found on the following
network drive path:
Vol2 on 'Hpchousrdc02'(Q:)\Shared HDesign\Torque calcs\PLUGTORQUE R2.xls"
2.0 Data Input:
2.1 Enter: Job number, item numbers, customer name, plant location, and the initials of
engineer using worksheet.
2.2 Tube size (aD) of tubes used in bundle.
2.3 Gasket "m" and "y" factors from gasket manufacturer data or current ASME Code,
Section VIII-Division I, Appendix 2, Table 2-5.1. This information is based on the
type and material of gasket.
2.4 Gasket, plug, and plate minimum yield strengths from current ASME Code, Section
II, Part D, Properties.
2.5 Test pressure (usually hydrotest, can be pneumatic as well).
3.0 Results:
3.1 Thread T: Maximum torque that can be applied to plugs without thread yield in
either the plate or plug.
3.2 Yield T: Maximum torque that can be applied to plugs whereby gasket begins to
yield without yielding plug or plate threads.
3.3 Recommended T (Lesser value of the following conditions): Condition 1: Torque
applied to yield gasket. Gasket yield threshold force exceeds force required for
operating conditions/gasket seating. Condition 2: Torque required meeting
operating conditions and seat gasket without yielding threads (operating
conditions/gasket seating forces due to high pressure exceed gasket yield
threshold). This is the torque value that should appear on header 6A drawings.

NOZZLE FLANGE FINISH
1.0 The current HPC standard on nozzle flange face finish is 125 to 250 AARH finish.
1.1 Our flange vendors are supplying this finish to HPC as an off-the-shelfstandard.
1.2 Vendor furnished material is manufactured to ANSI B16.5 specifications.
2.0 Whenever any other flange face finish is used, it should be noted on the General
Arrangement drawing, Header BaM, and the Header drawing.

THREDOLETS AND COUPLINGS
1.0 Standard practice is to implant couplings into the top/ bottom plates and nozzle pipes and
transitions.
1.1 The exception to this rule is when the plate thickness is such that the effect of a
coupling can be accomplished by drilling and tapping a hole instead.
1.2 The reason for exception is due to the amount of welding and time required to
implant the couplings into a relatively thick plate.
2.0 For designs where set-on connections are acceptable, thredolets are preferred. Thredolets
are manufactured with a bevel and thus eliminate the need for any extra turning by the
shop.

INSTRUMENT CONNECTION ARRANGEMENT
1.0 Instrument connections are furnished only when specified on Fin-Fan® Specification
Sheet.
2.0 Per API 661, 3rd edition, 1992, when specified, instrument connections are to be located in
at least one inlet and one outlet nozzle per bundle, except for intermediate nozzle of
stacked bundles.
3.0 Per API 661, 3rd edition, 1992, when specified, thermowell connections are to be located in
the nozzle unless nozzle is less than NPS.4 in., in which case the connection shall be on the
header adjacent to the nozzle.
4.0 Per API 661, 3rd edition, 1992, when specified, pressure gauge connections are to be
located in the nozzle unless the nozzle is less than NPS.3 in., in which case the connection
shall be on the header adjacent to the nozzle.
5.0 Per API 661, 3rd edition, 1992, threaded connections are NPS.1 in. except for pressure
gauge which can be NPS. 3/4 in. Some examples of threaded connections are drill and tap,
couplings, weld bosses, thredolets and sockolets. Except for couplings, which are implant
connections to nozzles, all threaded connections to nozzles are set- on. Some examples of
flanged connections are LWN & WN w/pipe.
6.0 All flanged connections to nozzles are implanted.
7.0 Illustration: when required on one inlet and one outlet nozzle.

EXTRUDED FINNED TUBES
1.0 Hudson HY-FW® extruded fin tubings have been proven superior compared to embedded
or wrap-on fins in terms ofmechanical strength, protection of tube liner from atmospheric
corrosion, and heat transfer capability.
2.0 Process
2.1 The degreased and de-rusted process tube is pushed into an aluminum tube and then
passed through a machine, of Hudson design and fabrication, which extrudes the
fins from the aluminum tube.
2.2 In the extruding process a force is applied to the aluminum tube and against the
process tube, creating a bond pressure of at least 1200 psi. In comparison, the
maximum bond pressure with a wrap-on fin is 120 psi.
2.3 This extra bonding avoids a gap between the fin and the tube and, therefore,
transfers the heat more effectively.
2.4 As the fins are extruded, part ofthe aluminum remains on the process liner creating
a complete and unbroken sheath along it, thereby, protecting it from atmospheric
corrOSIOn.
3.0 In comparison with embedded or wrap-on fins, extruded tubes have at least 30 percent
more aluminum weight per foot, thereby increasing the life and the corrosion resistance of
the unit.

EMBEDDED FINNED TUBES
1.0 Hudson embedded finned tubes are ofthe metal and thickness specified for the fluid
service.
2.0 Process
2.1 Aluminum fins mechanically wrapped under tension and embedded within the wall
ofthe tube ina groove (.011 inch ±.002 inch deep) spirallyplowed into the outside
surface ofthe tube with the tube material peened back against the fin base on both
sides
3.0 Tube wall thickness, specified by the job specifications, is measured from the bottom ofthe
groove to the ID ofthe tube.
4.0 Tube metal is peened or rolled back against the fin with a locking joint effect sufficient to
withstand a pull test of 10 pounds per inch offin root (prime tube aD) for minimum of 30
seconds.

RUN-OFF TAB MATERIAL
1.0 Run-off tabs only to be billed out for non-carbon steel jobs. For carbon steel, the shop can
use drop from other plates.
2.0 Run-off tab material is to be shown in the header design bill-of-material, on header
drawing, and in the visibility bill-of-materials.
3.0 When welding through top and bottom plates:
3.1 The material is to consist ofthe following dimensions: width will be the exterior
width ofthe header box (inside width plus tube & plug sheet thickness) x (3" long)
x (top/bottom thickness + 114" minimum *).
3.2 A quantity of four is required per header box.
4.0 If the inside ofthe header box is 6" or greater:
4.1 The run-offtabs will have the following dimensions: (3" wide) x (3" long) x
(top/bottom thickness + 114" minimum *).
4.2 A quantity of eight is required per header box.
5.0 When welding through the tube and plug sheets:
5.1 The run-off tabs will have dimensions of (3" wide) x (3" long) x (tube/plug sheet
thickness + 114" minimum *).
5.2 A quantity ofeight is required per header box.
6.0 For plate thickness shown in this procedure with (*):
6.1 Use thickness ofplate already in use on box, such that it satisfies the formula (i.e.,
for 1" top/bottom, 1-112" tube/plug: use 1-112" run-off tabs so as to prevent buying
1-114" plate.)
6.2 If top/bottom plate is the thickest plate on that item, shop can use run-off tabs at the
same thickness as the box.

BLOCKING MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS
1.0 Blocking materials for plug headers will be needed when full penetration welding is required on
partitions and/or stiffeners. This requires the box to be fabricated 'inside-out'.
1.1 Bocks are 1" thick xl" wide.
1.2 The length is equal to the inside header width plus 1/4".
1.3 Blocks will be spaced approximately 8" apart and located at the top and bottom ofeach
header. For example, for a 6'-0 long header, 20 blocks per box are required.
2.0 Blocking materials for flange coverplate headers will be required when installing flange plate to
header box.
~..
~::;
2.1 Blocks are 1" thick x 6" wide.
2.2 Blocks will be spaced approximately 8" apart and located
diagonally from top of flange plate to header box.
3.0 Blocking material for partitions on coverplate headers will require
vertical blocks.
3.1 Blocks are 1" thick xl" wide.
3.2 The length equals [ (the f/j
distance from the inside of
the partition to the inside of
the top or bottom plate
r
(whichever dimension is
I
less) ) + 1/2"].
3.3 Blocks will be spaced
approximately 8" apart.
4.0 Blocking material for coverplate headers that are manufactured in the single-half construction will
require vertical blocks.
4.1 Blocks are 1" thick x I" wide.
eLOCO::
4.2 The length equals (the distance from the inside ofthe top plate
to the inside of the bottom plate + 1/4").

service SA516 plate, certified to grades 60, 65 and 70.
2.0 General
2.1 All material to be vacuum degassed, normalized, and produced so to have sulfide shape
control.
2.1.1 Sulfide shape control is accomplished through the addition of Silicon and
Calcium.
2.1.2 The steel is also killed through the additions of Silicon and Aluminum.
2.2 Each plate required to be impact tested in accordance with UG84 of ASME Code,
Section VIII, Division 1.
2.2.1 Tests are to be performed in both longitudinal and transverse directions, at minus
500 F.
2.2.2 Impact test reports shall include all pertinent data, including sample
identification, material and heat number identification, heat treatment, test
method, test source, materials test temperature, energy absorbed, and for
information, the percent of shear in the fracture and mils of lateral expansion on
the compression side of the fracture.
2.3 Each plate to 100% straight-beam ultrasonically examined in accordance with SA578,
level II, with supplemental requirements S1 and S2.2 enforced.
2.3.1 S2.2 here is defined as any area with one or more discontinuities that produce a
continuous total loss of back reflection and cannot be encompassed with a 1"
diameter circle is unacceptable.
2.4 Mechanical tests are to be performed for each plate after a post-weld heat treat, III
accordance with UCS56 of ASME Code, Section VIII, Division 1, e.g.:
a) Maximum heating rate above 8000 F to 2000 F per hour until 1100-11500 F is
reached.

GUIDELINES FOR ORDERING PLATE
1.0 PL-2 Plate
1.1 For each thickness ofPL-2 required, total quantity will be calculated based on percentage
of a full-size sheet.
1.2 For thickness through 1-3/4", the full-size sheet will measure 96" x 336".
1.3 For thickness of2" and above, full-size sheets will measure 96" x 192".
1.4 All plates for each thickness should be nested into one larger piece with %" cutting
allowance between them and one inch added to both the length and width. Final plate size
will be these dimensions rounded up to the nearest inch.
1.5 After the final plate size is determined, the area of that plate should be divided by the area
of a full-size sheet. This number is the value to be entered into Visibility for plate
quantity.
2.0 Carbon Steel (Non-PL-2)
2.1 All carbon steel plate that is not PL-2 will require cutting schematics.
2.2 These schematics should consist of all plates for each particular thickness nested into one
larger piece with %" cutting allowance provided between the individual pieces.
2.3 For final plate size, the length and width should be rounded up to the nearest inch.
2.4 A copy of the checked schematics should be given to purchasing.
3.0 Alloy Steel
3.1 For alloy steel plate, engineering will provide a cutting sheet to purchasing.
3.2 This cutting sheet will be a Xerox copy of the checked header design bill-of-materials and
will include the following information in hand-written form:
a) Part number for the plate
b) Total cutting allowance for the plate
c) The title "Cutting Sheet" at the top of the form
3.3 For plug headers, alloy plate Y2" or thinner will require cutting schematics since this plate
will be cut by the shop.
3.3.1 In addition, all alloy end plates, regardless of thickness, will require separate
cutting schematics.
3.3.2 These schematics should consist of the end plates nested in a single strip with W'
cutting allowance between each piece and 1,4" cutting allowance at each end.
3.4 For coverplate headers, engineering will provide cutting schematics which will show
these plates nested into one larger plate with an additional 2" cutting allowance between
each individual piece and 1" cutting allowance at each end.

Subject: Implant nozzle extensions
This email serves as documentation of a conclusion in our header design meeting. For implant transitions, we will make
the transition the same standard length (i.e. 6" or 8") and will adjust the overall nozzle extension accordingly. Obviously,
this may not apply for customer driven nozzle extensions (i.e. matching replacement nozzle height, etc.) This may also
need to be adjusted for instrument connections that get too far up into the flange-to-transition weld, although a certain
amount of interference into the weld is permitted.
For consistency, this will also apply to pipe nozzles and LWNs. Use the standard length of pipe or LWN and adjust
extension.

The following fist of nozzle lengths are the maximum
lenghts the header shop feel they can reach inside to weld
or grind to achieve the quaHty required to pass code or
customer requirements.
Should stiffners be required in any of these lenghts we will .
install stiffners after nozzle is welded to header box.'
I would also like to say; the longer the nozzles are, the
more time it takes to weld or grind.
The maximum length is from face of flange to header box.

Subject: RE: Additional length for pipe...
Here's an update from conversation with Mark Krolczyk.
Everything I assumed below is true. We are not changing the descriptions of any parts. The raw material quantity in Vis
will be the required length of pipe (before swaging for transitions) plus 1". This will include all cutting widths and
beveling/machining allowances. This does not include the additional 1/8" for implant transitions (to grind down the bottom
surface smooth.)
Steve is compiling the list of affected parts that will need EBOM update. I will update our transition and pipe cutting chart
in the next few days and will distribute.

Subject: RE: Additional length for pipe...
Current standards for pipe length (meaning "non-transitions") is 7/16" total additional added to the raw material pipe
=
length in Vis. ( 3/16" cutting allowance + 1/8" beveling/machining at each end.) Pipes are called out as true length
on the header design BaM and on Vis. part numbers, but additional length is added to raw material quantity.
Standard for transition pipe length is "cut length" (which is a function of set-on vs. implant, and nozzle size and
schedule) plus 3/16" total added to the raw material pipe length in Vis. Transition pipes are called out as true "finished
length" and "cut length" on the header design BaM and on Vis. part number, but additional length is added to raw
material quantity.
The above rules were for all material types.
Now we have a new rule for non-carbon steel (which I am assuming to mean everything except plain CS and Cr-Mo):
use 1" cutting allowance for each pipe piece. I am further assuming this is for both pipes and transitions, and this is
the total added for all cutting/beveling/machining operations (replacing the 7/16" for pipes and 3/16" for transitions.) I
am also assuming we are only talking about changing the raw material quantities in Vis., not changing the actual call
out piece lengths in the header design bom and Vis. part descriptions.
Please advise if otherwise, else we will implement to revise the history of nozzle pipe part EBOMs in the system, and
will update our standard cut-length charts.

Subject: Additional length for pipe...
The Lean Manufacturing Team has asked that we increase the cutting allowance for all alloy pipe. We should
include 1" cutting allowance for each piece of pipe that is to be cut.
Please coordinate this so that we end up with the additional pipe length.
Thanks, Ed...

EMBEDDED FINNED TUBES
1.0 Hudson embedded finned tubes are of the metal and thickness specified for the fluid
service.
2.0 Process
2.1 Aluminum fins mechanically wrapped under tension and embedded within the wall
of the tube in a groove, (.011 inch ± .002 inch deep) spirally plowed into the outside
surface of the tube with the tube material peened back against the fin base on both
sides
3.0 Tube wall thickness, specified by the job specifications, is measured from the bottom of the
groove to the ID of the tube.
4.0 Tube metal is peened or rolled back against the fin with a locking joint effect sufficient to
withstand a pull test of 10 pounds per inch of fin root (prime tube aD) for minimum of30
seconds.
