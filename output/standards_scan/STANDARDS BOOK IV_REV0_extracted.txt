Revision to Standard Parts . May 11,2006
Attached are revised fan ring drawings 02ROO and 03ROO reflecting design changes to the ribbed quarter fan rings
(2RR__ and 3RR__ parts). Both the 30" and 24" deep fan ring designs will now have 13/32" square punches within
the fan rings and 318" round head short square neck bolts will be used to connect the quarter rings and splice plates
together in lieu of the 3/8" studs welded onto the fan rings. Additionally, the 30" deep fan ring design was revised so
that the ribs are now located along the upper portion of the fan ring depth. The fasteners required for these fan rings are
noted on the revised standard drawings: the fasteners are to be listed on the Shop Bolt Summary or Field Bolt Summary
according to the fan rings assembly requirement.
The use of these new fan ring designs is effective immediately. Please update your Standard Book IV accordingly.
Add the Table of Contents to Section 3; this page was created to reflect the revision to drawings 02ROO through
03TOO.

Standard Book IV Revision October 3,2001
See attached for the latest revision to Standards Book IV. Please remove the existing position strip drawings,
07POO, 07POl, 07P02, 07P04, and 07P05, from your Standard Book IV and replace with the attached nine
drawings. The use ofthese new standard parts will go into effect immediately on all jobs not yet issued.
Details of revision:
The position strip drawings were expanded from five to nine drawings in order to incorporate new standard
parts for 3/8" thick position strips. The new nine drawings are organized according to position strip
thickness. Similarly to the original drawings, the new drawings contain tabulated standard position strip for

Revision to Standard Book IV September 9,2000
The HPC standard part system has been changed in order to eliminate detailing ETO versions of standard parts when
the coating and/or material specification differs from HPC standards. Standard part numbers (e.g., B701, W701, 2R25,
and 4M2 I) will now be referred to as model numbers. This new system provides flexibility in handling numerous part
variations because only dimensional and fabrication information is now provided for the model on the drawing.
The Book IV drawings will not contain material or coating references, the raw material part number(s), the term part
number, or the preceding number 0 on the model number. At this time only a few Book IV drawings are updated;
eventually all Standard Book IV drawings will be updated to reflect this new method. Each Book IV section will
contain an outline providing coating and material references, and part exceptions. Weights appearing on the model
drawings are estimations based on HPC standards; these weights are references only, see Visibility for actual part
weight.
Coating and material specifications will be located in the Visibility description and/or BOM. Create ETO parts when
material form or dimensional feature differs from the model (e.g., pressed angle substitution for structural angle or
oversize holes).
See page 2 for revision details. See attached for the latest revisions to the HPC Standard Parts Book IV. The use of
these parts and the system outlined above will go into effect immediately on all jobs not yet issued. If you have any
questions or comments concerning the contents, please contact me at ext. 5873

Additions to Standard Book IV August 9, 1999
i
See attached for the latest revisions to the HPC Standard Parts Book IV. The use ofthese new standard parts will go
into effect immediately on all jobs not yet issued.
Attached are 7 drawings containing new standard position strip parts. Drawings 07POO through 07P05 contain
standard position strips parts for process headers. Drawing 07P06 contains standard position strips parts for steam
coil headers.
These new drawings contain tabulated standard position strips for 25 various pitches and three flat bar sizes;
however not all of these standard position strip parts have been entered into the Visibility database. Standard parts
for the Tube count chart pitches and the steam coil position strips have been created and entered into Visibility. The
remaining position strip parts will be entered into Visibility as the need arises; request the entry of a position strip
part number by notifying the Standards Department via e-mail (Rita Medina) or phone call (extension 5975).
Please add the attached 7 charts to your HPC Standard Book IV, Section 7, after drawing 07M04.
You should become familiar with these standards and perfonn your duties in strict compliance with this standard. If
you have any questions or comments concerning the contents, please contact me at ext. 5873

effective immediately. Please add these drawings to your Standard Book IV, section #4. Also, replace index
HPC STD. PG 9 with the attached index sheet.
These assembly drawings contain the individual standard parts. In the past the individual standard part was
detailed on a separate drawing and only shown or noted on the assembly drawing. Detailing the standard parts
and the assembly on one drawing will help eliminate some confusion when providing standard part drawings to
outside customers. We will continue to use this drawing configuration whenever possible, so please provide your
comments on it to the Standards Department (J. Galvan at 5938).

Revisions and Additions to Standard Book IV DA1eptember 15, 1997
The necessity of the attached shafts requires the Standards Department to deviate from the usual method of
updating Standard Book IV. The use of these revised and new standards will go into effect immediately on all new
jobs that have not been detailed. Please discard current drawings of and replace with the enclosed package.
Attached you will find the following revisions and additions to Standard Book IV:
• Revised tolerances and material description per engineering request on shaft drawings 04AOl, 04A02, 04A03,
04A04, 04A05, 04A06, 04A07, 04A08, 04A09, 04AlO, 04All and 04A12.
• Created four drawings for new standard forced draft fan shafts to be used with 14" deep machinery mounts.
Drawings 04A18 and 04A19 are for shafts constructed of stressproof material, while 04A20 and 04A21 are

Revisions and Additions to Standard Book IV DA1eptember 2, 1997
The necessity of the attached tube bundle frame standard parts requires the Standards Department to deviate from
the usual method of updating Standard Book IV. The use of these new standards will go into effect immediately
on all new jobs that have not been detailed. Please discard current drawings of and replace with the enclosed
package. Attached you will find the following revisions and additions to Standard Book IV:
• Revised coating requirement from galvanized to none for header pad angle B70 I, which in effect obsoletes part
W713. Revised the drawing and Visibility BOM of reinforced header pad 07AOI to reflect the addition of
B70I in place of W7I3. Created header pad angle B735 for hot dip galvanizing coating requirements. See
drawings OB701, OB709, 07AOI and delete drawing OW7I3 from your standards book.
• Created standard parts for plan brace angles, see drawings B705 and B706. Revision of the plan brace assembly
drawings, 07HOI and 07H02, is incomplete at this time. However, the Visibility BOM for the plan brace
assemblies have been updated in the system. At this time leave drawings 07HOI and 07H02 in your book.
• Created a standard part for the 30° side seal clip. Revised and relocated part T702 to the bolted section (section
I)of Standard Book IV. See drawings B705 and B706, notice part number did not change. Delete drawing
T702 from your standards book.
At this time, only drawings OB701, OB705, OB706, OB707, OB708, OB709, 07AOI and 07B70 are being
distributed. The forthcoming Revisions and Additions to Standard Book IV package will include these drawings
along with an updated index. Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause. If you have any questions or

Additional comments:
Recently there was a confusion between DRAWING W722 and PART NUMBER W722 that lead to the erroneous changing
of both the part description and bill of material on standard part W722 without following the proper HPC procedures. This confusion
brings to the forefront three very important issues.
The first issue is the distinguishing difference between PART NUMBER and DRAWING NUMBER when dealing with
standard parts. Standard Book IV contents have been designed in a manner to distinguish a bolt part from a welded part from a part
assembly. The standard part nomenclature is outlined on page PN-l, titled Part Number Identification and should be the first page
following the Table Of Contents. In developing new standard parts, the Standards Department has maintained this long standing
Hudson Products alphanumeric nomenclature. The standard drawing nomenclature in Standard Book IV is also a long standing Hudson
Products system. Despite the fact that in the past the drawing number matched or correlated with the part number, the Standards
Department is unable to locate documentation requiring such a system. Therefore, with the addition of tabulated standard parts the
method of using sequential drawing number regardless of the standard part numbers on the drawing is a more workable method. The
standard drawings are still prefixed and sectioned off to distinguish bolt, welded and part assemblies for ease in locating. Standard
bolted and welded parts are prefixed with the letters Band Wand indexed in sections I and 2. Standard part assemblies are prefixed with
the series number (3, 4, 5, etc.) and indexed in section 3 through 8. The Table of Contents is also laid out to make for easy reference
to the part(s) and references the drawing number the part is located.
The second issue pertains to the revising of a standard part outside the Standard Department. The Standards Department
follows a procedure of researching revisions to standard parts before making such revisions, regardless of the revision being a drawing
or Visibility revision. The Standard Department also follows a procedure of entering a part number (with drawing number in the
Engineering screen), creating bills of material, adding routing, and costing a standard part. Following the completion of these
Visibility entries, the BOM Administrator checks and approves for Visibility use the part number, part description and bill of material.
Production Engineering reviews the ROUTING steps and Accounting verifies the COST of the part before completing the ROLL
phase on the standard part. Overlooking these procedures obstructs the efforts in maintaining accuracy and accountability of standard
parts.
Third issue. The revising of a standard part without notifying the Standards Department is a very critical issue. It is
necessary that procedures that have been created to deter this type of situation from happening be followed. Please, everyone become
aware of Engineering & Drafting Procedure Change No 47 Rev 1, dated April 9, 1997, titled PARTS MASTER CHANGES. The
revision to standard part W722 was not handled by, nor were Standards Department personnel made aware of the original inquiry or the
revisions to the Visibility Part. The revision was also done erroneously, wrong material size, and not checked nor approved by the
BOM Administrator. To have avoided this situation, the Standards Department should have been made aware of the original confusion
between drawing and part numbers. The BOM Administrator should have been made aware of a pending BOM revision. Unlike
Engineered to Order parts, standard parts are not exclusive to a specific job but rather prevalent to any number of jobs.
In the future, please forward all inquires to standard part numbers and or description to the Standards Department, BOM
Administrator and or the Part Master. More importantly, no revision to a standard part should be made by anyone other than the
Standards Department personnel or the Part Master Administrator who will verify the revision prior to making the revision, acquire
checking and approval of revision. Additional copies of this procedure and addition to the distribution list may be requested by
contacting the Standards Department, extension 5938 or myself, extension 5873.

Revisions and Additions to Standard Book IV 8,1996
See attached for the latest revisions to the H.P.C. Standard Parts Book IV. Please discard your
original drawings and replace with the enclosed package according to the revised index. The latest
revisions consist of the following:
I. Revised drawing index sheets I, 3,4, 5, 6, and 8.
2. Revised header pad (B70 I) to provide adequate space for impact wrench usage on the inside of
the frame. Created a standard part (B703) for a header anchor pad. The Tube Frame
Component Identification drawing (7870) was revised to include the new header anchor pad.
3. Revised drawing W4670 to correct the material description of part W467 from 2 1/2 x 2 1/2
angle to 2 1/2 x 2 angle.
4. Revised W835 for 3'-0 wide platform. Created right and left handrail corner post (W841 Rand
W841L) to meet requirements of note 3, 8SD6 HPC Walkway Standard.
5. Revised the forced draft inlet bell 11/32 diameter holes to 7/32 diameter. This will allow the use
of one size screw for all inlet bells and entails the revision of all forced draft fan guards. See
drawings 04GOO, 04GO I, 04G02. 04G03, 04JOO, 04J02, 04K03, 04K04, 04K05, 04WO I,
04W02, 04W03, 04XOI, 04X02, 04X03, and 04X04.
6. The HPC standard belt guard will now be the Hinged Belt Guard. For HPC (Beasley)
manufactured guards use standard part drawings 04H02 and 04H04. For HPM (Mexico)
manufactured guards use standard part drawings 04Y02 and 04Y04. Show belt guard hinged
on General Arrangement drawing as shown on page 2. (No drawings will be included for this
revision)
The use of these new standards will go into effect immediately on all new jobs that have not been
detailed.
If you have any questions or comments concerning the contents, please contact me at ext. 5873.

PART NUMBER IDENTIFICATION - Models and Standard Parts
MODELS
A model is defined as the design of an HPC component or assembly. Each model is assigned a specific number and is not
exclusive to a specific job but rather prevalent to any number ofjobs; therefore, the design is considered a standard model.
The standard model number is the identification number of the particular model design. Standard models may vary in size,
shape, and type - component or assembly. Component models have the letters B (for BOLTED) and W (for WELDED)
preceding the model number; assembly models have the series number as the first or second digit. The model drawings
contain dimensional and fabrication information only. Drawings for bolted and welded models are cataloged in sections I
and 2. Drawings for the HPC assembly models are cataloged in sections 3 through 8. A model (e.g., B004, B701) may be
used in any non-standard shop assembly and shipped loose for any applicable field-bolted conditions.
The following model numbers are samples as to how they will appear on the Standard Book IV drawings:
B 7 01 BOLTED-ON and WELDED-ON COMPONENT (where B = Bolted; W = Welded)

STANDARD PARTS
A standard part is defIned as the component from a pre-designed model cataloged within Standards Book IV and used in any
type of unit and fabricated. The following is the standard part number format:
coating code + model number + material code
Coating and material codes are defIned on the outline located at the front of each Standard Book IV section. The Visibility
BOM will be the sources for material and coating; the coating sheet (CI) should agree with the Visibility BOM coating
requirements. The following are examples of standard parts:
0 2 R 34 (where 0 galvanized)
1 2 R 34 (where 1 coating variation)
0 2 R 34 -1 (where 0 galvanized; -1 = material variation)
1 2 R 34 -1 (where 1 coating variation; -1 = material variation)
Standard part numbers are listed on the lO-series drawing for erecting identifIcation and in the Parts List by the customer's
item number for the shipping department's use. Sub-level bolted and welded part numbers are not required on the la-series
drawing and the Parts List.
Shop-assembly part numbers are located in the detail drawing, assembly bill of material, and in the Parts List as a bolted
template.
Field assembly part numbers are only listed in the Bill of Material, the la-series drawing, and the Part List.

EXCEPTIONS
Exceptions to this system are listed within each section outline. These standard parts may have material variations, therefore,
the material code may follow model number
*
Part number format = 0 + model number + material code (0 coating code)
Example:
*
W 701 WELDED-ON MODEL (appears as OW701; where 0 coating code)
*
6 N 12-25 NITROGEN PURGE COVERS (appears as 06N12-25; where -25 material code)

Subject: Position strip retainer design I
Per John Galvan.
After discussions with the shop on position strip retainers, the following designs are effective immediately:
a) For lengths up to and including 10" use a single standard retainer part. See drawing W727 in STD BK 4.
b) If the length is greater than 10", the W-shaped retainer is detailed to the required length.
c) If the "X" dimension is less than 1", use two bars (Yz" or %" thick) in lieu of the W-shaped part. See drawing W727.
d) If the "X" dimension is less than 3/8", note on the drawing to TIE POSITION STRIPS IN PLACE WITH WIRE.
e) Angle-design retainers are no longer used.
These designs should be incorporated in ProE in the near future.
Please forward comment/questions to John Galvan at 8138.

Subject: Position strip retainer design I
Per John Galvan.
After discussions with the shop on position strip retainers, the following designs are effective immediately:
a) For lengths up to and including 10" use a single standard retainer part. See drawing W727 in STD BK 4.
b) If the length is greater than 10", the W-shaped retainer is detailed to the required length.
c) If the "X" dimension is less than 1", use two bars (W' or %" thick) in lieu of the W-shaped part. See drawing W727.
d) If the "X" dimension is less than 3/8", note on the drawing to TIE POSITION STRIPS IN PLACE WITH WIRE.
e) Angle-design retainers are no longer used.
These designs should be incorporated in ProE in the near future.
Please forward comment/questions to John Galvan at 8138.
