The general structure of the document has changed drastically; most ofthe content has not except
for the following.
Forced draft units now have a 'base unit' assembly (HOOO-345A) that is composed ofthe 3A, 4A,
and 5A assemblies. This base unit assembly is a phantom assembly and will not receive a work
order.
Standard fan rings and stub-column air seals will be placed into either the HOOO-345A or HOOO-A
assemblies (HOOO-345A ifforced draft, HOOO-l if induced).
Created part HOOO-7A-AS to group the retaining air seals together; place it in the bundle assembly.
Revised the operation linking in the bundle bill to show non-painted header parts to be linked to
operation 0300 instead of0200.

Standards Book Feedback I 1999
In February of this year, TQM team, CIT2 completed the HPC standard procedure books. There is a total of
four standards book: Standard Book I -Work instructions
Standard Book II, volumes I and II - Work instructions, engineering standards and
drawing references for designing and
detailing ACHEs.
Standard Book III - Header designing and detailing standards
Standard Book IV - Standard parts and assemblies
The method for gathering feedback on the issued procedures is noted on the issuance memo of Standard
Book II as "Any discrepancies within this book as well as in the previously issued Standard Books I, III,
IV, are to be copied, marked-up and turned over to the Standard Department". At this time the method for
collecting feedback is being altered.
In lieu of turning over marked-up copies to the Standards Department please begin using the following
method for making comments on or marking-up these procedures. This new method allows streamlining of
incoming comments and helps avoid duplication of comments. This method also allows for review of
previous comments by all department personnel.
Feedback books have been created for the sole purpose of collecting your comments and or contributions to
HPC standards. These books are unique in their paper color of peach and are located on the back white-top
table in area 777E.
When contributing comments or information, please remove the stapled book section, sign out on the log
sheet in the front of the book, make your comment and return the section as soon as possible. Comments are
to be clearly noted, initialed and may be made to existing comments. Suggested additions to the standards
should be noted as such and placed in the suggested book and book section.
Ifyou have any questions or comments concerning the contents, please contact me at 5873.

ISUBJEcr: Move Tickets for Heade:;OX:wings I December 18, 1998
This memo concerns the performance of move tickets on header drawings. It supersedes the work
instruction entitled, Time & Attendance and Move Tickets in Standards Book I, only for the situation
described here. If you are working on a header drawing that does not fit the following situation, you
MUST use the instructions in the Standards Book to perform move tickets.
The situation: You are working on a header drawing, detailing or checking, and the header
design has not yet been completed.
Time Charging: Log into the work order and operation normally, per the above mentioned work
instruction.
Move Tickets: When you are ready to perform a move ticket, per the above mentioned work
instruction, inform production engineering. They will do the move ticket for you.
Currently the system is set up so that when a move ticket is performed, all previous operations are also
completed. On header drawings, this will close operations for header design, when they really aren't
complete. There is a way to do move tickets without this problem, but it is a complicated process.
Therefore, production engineering will do move tickets for drafting in these situations only.
Ifyou have any questions or comments concerning the contents contact Frank Traynor at ext. 5800.

3.0 THE ENGINEERING STANDARDS BOOKS
3.1 The engineering standards books are a collection ofwork instructions, engineering
standards, and drawings.
3.1.1 These documents describe how work is done in the Engineering department.
3.1.2 Some ofthese work instructions define how to perfonn administrative tasks such
as recording labor transactions for different tasks.
3.1.3 Others give more general infonnation on how certain types ofjobs should flow
through the department.
3.1.4 Some of the work instructions, combined with engineering standards, defme how
engineering documents and drawings are to be created. They provide infonnation
on how Air Cooled Heat Exchangers are designed and built.
3.1.5 Lastly, these books contain drawing masters and drawings ofstandard parts that
will help reduce the drafting and engineering time associated with ACHE design.
3.2 These work instructions, drawings, etc. are segregated into five different books. Books that
become to large to fit in one binder will be further segregated by volume.
3.2.1 Standards Book I is a collection of a wide range of work instructions. It includes
several miscellaneous work instructions for how work is done in the Engineering
department. It also discusses how department personnel should interact with the
main manufacturing database being used by HPC. This includes the entering of
information into Visibility~.
3.2.2 Standards Book II will define how ACHEs are designed. This includes work
instructions, engineering standards, and drawings that will assist the Drafting
Department in designing each component of a bank of ACHEs. This will range
from thecreation oflarge numbers ofdrawings that detail the lower structural
members to the creation of letter sized documents like the Coating Sheet and Fan
Order Fonn.
3.2.3 Standards Book III contains engineering design standards, drawings, and work
instructions for the design ofthe Headers in our process bundles.
3.2.4 Standards Book IV is acollection ofdrawings ofstandard parts used inACHE
construction. These are parts that have been designed and detailed in advance of
their use on jobs.
3.2.5 Standards Book V is the Instruction Manual that is given to ACHE customers.
3.3 When there is a disagreement between one ofthe Engineering & Drafting Procedure
Changes or other Engineering documents issued previously, and any ofthese books, these
books will take precedence.

distribution list will vary from book to book. The Standards Department will maintain a
record of the distributions.
4.3.1 Those that receive a copy ofa standards book, will also receive copies of
revisions to that book.
4.3.2 Since several different people will have his or her own copy, the likelihood exists
that the books may not be kept current or extraneous documents may be added to
them.
4.3.3 Ifthere is everadifference between any hardcopy version ofthe books and the
electronic version, the electronic version will always take precedence. This
includes the master copy kept in the Standards Department.
5.0 MAINTENANCE

5.1.3 All procedures issued as part of a standards book will start with a revision number
ofO. This is even if that procedure had been issued separately, with a later
revision number, prior to the book's release.
5.1.4 A memo will be sent via electronic mail to all HPC personnel who have electronic
mail service. This memo will state that the book is being issued and where the
electronic versionscan be found. The memo will also state that ifcopiesofthe
books are made, their own copies may not be up-to-date ifthey do not follow
every future electronic memo.
5.2 Revisions to Documents in Standards Books
5.2.1 Ifa document in a standards bookhas to be revised, the revision number ofthat
document will be increased by 1. Only the document being revised will have its
revision number increased.
5.2.2 A hard copy will be distributed to everyone logged with the Standards
Department as having a copy.
5.2.3 A memo will be sent via electronic mail to all HPC personnel who have electronic
mail service. This memo will state which procedure in which book was revised.
It will also give the file name ofthe document and a briefdescription ofthe
revision.

TIME & ATTENDANCE AND MOVE TICKETS
1.0 PURPOSE
1.1 To insure time charges in the system are accurate and timely.
1.2 To insure move tickets are done properly & timely.
1.3 This document addresses the issue ofhow to charge time and perform move tickets; it does
not address when and whom. Refer to Drawings in Standards Book I, section 3C for
information on when and whom.
1.4 Paragraph 3.0 gives a general overview of a typical day with time charging and move
tickets. It explains when to assign yourself to work and perform move tickets.
1.5 Paragraph 4.0 explains how to use Time & Attendance to assign yourselfto work.
Department 31 (Drafting) should use this procedure to charge time. There are two methods
for work assignment: job assignment and manual assignment.
1.5.1 Use job assignment for most project-related work. In some rare cases, overhead
tasks will also appear in the job assignment screens, such as TQM work.
1.5.2 Use manual assignment for revisions and miscellaneous documents.
1.5.3 There are also circumstances where you will need to assign yourself to overhead
work that does not appear in any ofthe job assignment screens. This could
include training and special projects.
1.5.3.1 Use manual assignment to assign yourselfto these kinds of tasks.
1.5.3.2 You should never assign yourselfto work other than what appears in
job assignment, revisions, or miscellaneous documents without
authorization from a Section Leader, the Drafting Supervisor, or the
Engineering Manager.
1.6 Paragraph 5.0 explains how to perform a move ticket, ifa move ticket is required.
1.7 Appendix A provides a table that lists all of the work centers and work center stations used
in the Engineering and Drafting departments.
1.8 Throughout this procedure, words enclosed in single quotation marks (' ') are the names of
actual fields in Visibility. Letters, numbers, and marks that are in bold face type are actual
Visibility inputs by the user.

SALARIED TIMESHEET ENTRY
1.0 PURPOSE
1.1 To insure time charges in the system are accurate and timely.
1.2 Paragraph 3.0 explains when to charge time and perfonn move tickets.
1.3 Paragraph 4.0 explains how to use Salaried Timesheet Entry to charge time. Departments
33 and 34 (Engineering Support and Direct Engineering) should use this procedure to
charge all oftheir time, ifrequired.
1.4 Appendix A lists overhead feature codes. These should be used for non-project related
tasks that get charged to departmental overhead.
1.5 This work instruction is to be used in conjunction with Time & Attendance and Move
Tickets in Standards Book I, section 2A.
1.5.1 Refer to this procedure when performing move tickets after completing a task.
1.5.2 You may also want to refer to appendix B in that document which lists all ofthe
work centers and work stations used in the department.
1.6 This procedure assumes that you will charge your time at the end of each business day. If
you do not, there is no guarantee that the process described in paragraph 4.0 will work.
Problems that could occur include:
1.6.1 The closing ofthe work order prior to time entry which results in your inability to
properly charge your time.
1.6.2 Having to type a date in the 'Date' field instead ofpressing <ENTER> to get the
default date (see 4.5), etc.
1.6.3 Furthennore, unless you keep a written log ofyour time (which is duplicate work
and more time consuming) you will most likely charge an incorrect quantity of
hours. This will make future time estimates more inaccurate.
1.7 This document addresses the issue of how to charge time. Refer to Drawings in Standards
Book I, section 3C for infonnation on the where time is to be charged and when to perfonn
move tickets.
1.8 Throughout this procedure, words enclosed in single quotation marks (' ') are the names of
actual fields in Visibility. Letters, numbers, and marks that are in bold face type are actual
Visibility inputs by the user.

7.2 If the shaft is from an older job, Document Control provides the PMA and the salesperson
with a copy ofthe older drawing.
7.3 If the shaft is not from a previous job and a new drawing is required, the PMA must consult
the Drafting Supervisor. The job package should contain all pertinent information required
to detail the new shaft.
7.4 The drawing, old or new, is checked and submitted to Document Control. The bill should
conform to Bill ofMaterials Creation in Standards Book I, section 3B with the
understanding that other components, such as base plates, may be required.
7.5 The PMA enters the part numbers. There are two types of part numbers for fan shaft
assembly.
7.5.1 The first type ofpart number is for an HPC shaft. The old part number (e.g.,
A300-101C-2) is used. The description is per Standards Book I, section 3B.
7.5.2 The second type ofpart number is for a non- HPC shaft. The part number
consists ofthe AOOOO series number (e.g., A0001). The part description format is
'SHAFT,competitor's name' followed by information required and provided by
the Fan and Parts salesperson.
7.6 The PMA inputs the BOM.
7.7 BOM Administrator checks the complete bill.
7.8 The PMA sends out the following message using electronic mail.

The message should be addressed to the following persons:
Fan & Part Sales Salesperson
Scheduling Supervisor
Make-for-Stock Planner
Drafting Supervisor
Production Engineering
Cost Accounting
8.0 SPARE PARTS JOBS
8.1 A salesperson in the Fan and Part Sales department submits a request for a quote to the
Drafting Supervisor.
8.2 The Drafting Supervisor assigns personnel to develop the quote.
8.3 After the quote is complete, the Drafting Supervisor gives it back to the salesperson.
8.4 When the quote becomes ajob, the salesperson needs to create a sales order.
8.5 If the total estimated drafting hours for the job is equal to or greater than 4 hours, the
salesperson should also add the part number 'ENG-DRAFT' to the sales order.
8.6 The salesperson then gives a job package to Production Engineering and the Drafting
Supervisor. The job package should include the following information:
a. List of parts that are to be delivered to the customer (the quote)
b. Required engineering and drafting hours
c. Due dates for engineering, drafting, and manufacturing
d. Any other pertinent information that may affect what is to be engineered or
fabricated
8.7 Production Engineering schedules all engineering and drafting work.
8.7.1 If the total drafting and engineering estimated hours is fewer than four, work
orders are not necessary. Production Engineering issues electronic mail notifying
the Drafting Supervisor to charge labor directly to the sales order; skip the
remaining step of8.7.
8.7.2 Production Engineering requests parts for drafting work orders from the PMA.
8.7.3 PMA creates the parts and gives confirmation to Production Engineering when
done.
8.7.4 Production Engineering creates a work order for the part 'ENG-DRAFT' linked to
the appropriate sales order line, then adds part numbers for all required drawings
to the Kitup and Shortage List for 'ENG-DRAFT'. The work order number for
this part should be 'D' plus the sales order number.
8.7.5 Production Engineering attaches a router for each drawing and creates work
orders that are linked to the work order for 'ENG-DRAFT'. Production
Engineering issues electronic mail to Drafting Supervisor confirming work orders
are complete.
8.8 The PMA creates a skeleton BOM, if necessary.
8.8.1 This skeleton BOM may be informal.

8.8.2 This skeleton BOM is submitted to the BOM Administrator for review.
8.9 Drafting and Engineering will perform necessary work per the job requirements and
established engineering work instructions.
8.10 Drafting will submit drawings to Document Control for part entry, bill entry, and document
issuance. All ofthese tasks should follow normal work instructions with no special
instructions.
8.11 The BOM Administrator will assist Document Control, when necessary, with bill input.
This may be necessary since some jobs can be very complex and most may not follow
normal bill structure. The BOM Administrator will check the bill input and approve the
release ofdocuments and drawings.
9.0 WARRANTY JOBS
9.1 Project Coordinator or Fan and Part Sales salesperson submits a job package to the Drafting
Supervisor and Production Engineering. This package should describe the scope ofthe
warranty, dates for deliveries, and explain how labor and materials will be expensed­
overhead or project number.
9.2 Production Engineering and the Drafting Supervisor will coordinate to determine the
following things:
a. Engineering and drafting requirements.
b. Engineering work order requirements-Production Engineering creates work
orders following the criteria mentioned above and issues electronic mail to
Drafting Supervisor outlining how labor is to be charged
c. Bill requirements-Production Engineering creates necessary bills and
explains to the Project Coordinator or Fan & Part Sales salesperson what will
be placed on the sales order.
d. Manufacturing work order requirements-coordinate with Production,
Planning & Scheduling to get necessary manufacturing work orders created.
9.3 Drafting and Engineering performs necessary work per job requirements and established
departmental work instructions.
9.4 Drawings and documents are checked, scrubbed, and released to Document Control.
9.5 Ifbill entry is required, Document Control coordinates with the PMA and Production
Engineering to accomplish this.
9.6 The only difference between the two types ofwarranty jobs, defined in 4.5, is the method
ofcharging material and labor.

Figure 1: Sample Assembly Diagram
3.1.1 Each square represents a manufactured pan. Each circle represents a purchased
part. All manufactured parts consist of manufactured and/or purchased
components connected at the next level below them.
3.1.2 The terms part, subpart, component, sub-component, assembly, and shbassembly
are all interchangeable. All items in the Visibility~ system are called parts. When
speaking ofparts, any ofthe terms just listed will often be used.
3.1.3 Components, either one or many, are parts that come together to form an
assembly. It does not matter how those parts how joined, whether welded or
fastened in some other manner.
3.1.4 Any part that consists of one or more components is an assembly. Every
assembly can also be considered a component if used on another assembly. In
this scenario, this assembly would also be referred to as a subassembly. ­
3.1.5 The terms assembly, subassembly and component are used to describe a part's
relationship to other parts.
3.1.6 In figure 1, numbers in parentheses represent the quantity of a component
required for each assembly shown above it. Quantity is defined in terms of the
unit of measure (UoM) for that part. In this example, manufactured part E is
composed of2 units ofpart h. IfpartEwere a gusset plate, then hmight
represent 1/2" thick A36 plate with a UoM ofsquare feet. Therefore, each gusset
would consist of2 units, or 2 sq. ft., of 1/2" plate.

3.1.7 Part B, in tum, consists of 1 unit ofmanufactured part E and 1.5 units of
purchased part f. IfB is a column, then fmight be W6xI5 beam material, and
each column consists of 1.5 ft ofthis beam and 1 gusset plate. This structure
continues for the rest of figure 1.
3.1.8 Ultimately, each part A consists ofthe following quantities of each purchased
part:
(l.S x 2) = 3
(1.5x1) = 1.S
=
(2xlx2 + 213) 10
=
(413) 12
3.1.9 Parts B, C, D, and E are merely groupings of raw material (the purchased parts),
but do not actually represent any true material. These subassemblies are only
defmed in terms of the components from which they are composed. All
assemblies and subassemblies are ultimately defined in terms of purchased parts
(the lowercase letters). All manufactured parts must ultimately consist ofone or
more purchased parts (i.e., all "roots" will end at a purchased part). The
exceptions to this are drawings.
3.2 Visibility~ structures all groupings, like those of figure 1, in terms ofparts (squares and
circles) and bills ofmaterials (connecting lines). A, B, C, D, E, f, g, h, and i are all parts.
All manufactured parts require a bill ofmaterial (BOM) to define what parts are joined to
create them. A, B, C, D, and E will, therefore, each require a BOM.
3.2.1 Parts:
3.2.1.1 Parts are identified by a unique number known as its part number (i.e.,
two parts cannot have the same number, and one part shouldn't be
listed under two different numbers). This part 'number' can actually
be composed ofnumbers, letters, and several symbols.
3.2.1.2 Parts are also defined by a description. In Visibility~ this description
can be 30 characters long. Descriptions longer than 30 characters may
be put in a separate field called the 'descriptor', also known as
'additional description'. Even though these two fields are separated by
Visibility, they combine to form one description for the part. When
procedures refer to a part's description they are referring to the
completed description.
3.2.1.3 A part cannot be used in a BOM until a part number has been added to
the Part Master. These part numbers can only be added to the Part
Master by the PMA.
3.2.1.4 Part numbers, when added, are entered as either make (M) or buy (B).
3.2.1.5 Buy parts are those for which no processing is required by HPC to get
it to the state described in the part's description. Buy parts include

bolts, plate, assemblies fabricated at Hudson Products de Mexico,
tubes, etc.
3.2.1.6 Make parts are those which require processing and are composed of
other 'make' parts and/or 'buy' parts. They include fans, tube bundles,
gusset plates, finned-tubes, etc.
3.2.2 Bill of Materials:
3.2.2.1 The single level BOM is simply a list of components, some
manufactured and some purchased, that are joined together to fonn an
assembly. This list includes the part numbers of the components of the
assembly and the quantity required to create one unit ofthat assembly.
3.2.2.2 In Visibility~, the BOM table stores the part number and quantity of
the components as well as other infonnation. This other infonnation
includes a spares factor, text, and several flags. This other infonnation
is important for Visibility~ to function properly and allow flexibility in
creating bills. They are not an inherent quality to bills in general.
3.2.2.3 An indented BOM is similar to a single level bill with the exception
that the single level bill for every assembly that is used as a component
is also portrayed. These series ofsingle level bills fonn a hierarchical
structure continuing for as many levels as necessary until only
purchased parts exist on the single level BOM.
3.2.2.4 Whenever an assembly is used as a component on a single level BOM,
that assembly's own single level BOM automatically becomes part of
the indented bill. This allows all bills to be stored as single level bills.
The indented BOM is simply a report that strings the single level bills
together. Bills are entered as single level for each assembly.
3.2.2.5 A BOM only exists in conjunction with a part. A BOM can be copied
from one part to another, but cannot exist separate from a part.
3.2.2.6 A part, when added to the Part Master, does not have a BOM. Ifa
manufactured part requires a BOM to defme its components, this must
be done separately.
3.2.2.7 A part can have only one BOM. This BOM follows that part
everywhere it is used on other bills.
3.2.2.8 Since the bill is only a list of components and gives no infonnation as
to how those components fit together, it is possible for more than one
part number to have the same BOM. Two braces differing only by
hole pattern, each composed of 10 linear feet of the exact same size
angle, would have the same BOM.
3.2.3 Figure 2 shows the bills of materials required for the assembly shown in figure 1.

3.2.3.1 Notice that the bills were listed from the bottom of figure I up. While
not required, this is a good practice for creating bills of materials.
Make it a practice to not list a subassembly in an assembly's BOM
until that subassembly has first had its own BOM created (i.e., do not
use subassembly B in assembly A's BOM until the BOM for
subassembly B has been created).
3.2.3.2 The exception to this is when creating the skeleton BOM. Some ofthe
subassemblies in the skeleton BOM will not have their own bills
completed until after drafting completes the appropriate details.
3.2.3.3 The skeleton BOM is an indented bill. It is composed of the major
assemblies that will receive work orders for fabrication and other
components that are known at the beginning ofthe job. This allows
for the creation of work orders and providc::s information as to the
structure of a job long before drawings are generated.
3.2.4 The bills ofmaterials shown in section 3.2.3 are single level. The indented BOM
for part A, based on the single level bills shown in section 3.2.3, is shown in table

3.2.5 Ifpart A were used in a higher level assembly, the indented BOM for that higher
level assembly would include the above structure for the part A component, but
all levels would be incremented by one (Le., Part A would be level 1, Parts B, C,
and D would be level 2, etc.). The level ofa part, which in Visibility~ is called
"indenture level", is variable based on which BOM is printed. The indenture level
is NOT constant for a given part. Do not confuse indenture level with the part
entry "LvI" (refer to 6.9.7).
3.2.6 Note about reading an indented BOM: a component at a particular indenture level
is part ofthesingle level bill ofthepart with a lower indenture level printed
before it in the indented BOM.
3.2.6.1 For example: part E and fare both at level 2 in table 1.
3.2.6.2 Each is a component on the single level BOM for assembly B, printed
above them with a lower indenture level (level 1).
3.2.6.3 Part h, is printed directly above f, but is of a higher level (level 3) then
part f.
3.2.6.4 The next lower level part above both parts E and f is part B.
Therefore, the single level bill for part B is a quantity of 1part E and
1.5 ofpart f.
4.0 ACHE PROJECT STRUCTURE
4.1 _A project's requirements are listed in a sales order, which is prepared in Visibility~ by the
Project Coordination Department. Each manufactured part in the sales order must have a
BOM.
4.2 The purpose ofthe BOM is to structure the components ofthe project similarly to the way
these components will be assembled, fabricated, and purchased (i.e., assembly part
numbers will be created for groups ofcomponents which are all collected and required at a
given time). The BOM structure will have assemblies and subassemblies, such that work
orders can be created as necessary to logically control the fabrication process.
4.3 For a standard ACHE project, the sales order will probably list units, loose field items, and
several different drawings as the sales order line items. This will be detennined by the

scope of the project. The HPC Engineering department must create a skeleton BOM for all
items listed on the sales order except the drawings. Higher level assembly parts will also
be created in the complete indented BOM for the project above the level of the parts shown
on the sales order. This is done for organization (i.e., part numbers for the banks and the
project itself). These higher level parts will allow the BOM to truly reflect the actual
required quantities without requiring access to the sales order.
4.4 See figure 3 for sample project HOOO. It consists of4 different items (bundles a, b, c, d)
arranged on 5 different bays (A,B,C,D,E) in 3 different banks ("A","B","C"). Each bank
has common substructure and complete walkways. Units B and C have the same layout
(i.e., the same panels and mechanical parts) but are different only because of their bundles
(alb & bib).
4.5 For the sample project in figure 3, the BOM structure will be as shown in figure 4. Each
block represents a part number with blocks below comprising that part's BOM.
4.5.1 The project part consists ofthe different bank parts.
4.5.2 Each bank part in tum, consists ofthe units in that bank and a part (Le., assembly
60A) grouping the loose shipped components in that bank.
4.5.3 Each unit consists of part numbers for the main subassemblies (panels, mach-mts.,
bundles, etc.) ofthat unit.
4.5.4 Each main subassembly would contain lower level assemblies and parts such as
colwnns, plenum panels, bolts, etc.
4.6 For replacement bundle jobs, the bundle (HOOO-6A-3) is listed directly in the project part's
BOM. If other loose pieces are required such as shipping spares, or other loose structural
or mechanical components, the 60A is also listed in the HOOO part. The Sales Order will
list the 6A-3 and the 60A. This can change depending on the scope of the job. Production
Engineering will make the decision when to deviate.
4.7 For retube, fan sales, or other part sales, the sales order line items will depend on the scope
of that particular job. If a project number is associated with the job then a project part
number will also be created (refer to Engineering & Drafting Process For Jobs in
Standards Book I, section 2C).
4.8 Non-standard jobs may require deviation from the standard structure such that the design
philosophy of paragraph-4.2 be maintained. In these cases, Production Engineering has
authority over deviations, and will coordinate these changes with all affected departments.

ACHE PROJECT PROCESS FLOW
5.1 Project process flow steps are coordinated by the Workflow module in Visibility~ (For
more details on the Project flow process steps. refer to 6.0 and 7.0).
5.2 The project's 'Job Package' is reviewed by Drafting, Header Design. Production
Engineering. and Structural Engineering. After this review, a kick-off meeting is held with
Engineering and the Project Coordinator to layout the Visibility~ project structure. It is at
this meeting that any non-standard conditions should be discussed. if known.
5.3 The BOM Administrator creates the Skeleton BOM Request Form per the job structure as
discussed in the kick-off meeting and defmed in the 'Job Package' (refer to Skeleton BOM
Request Form in Standards Book I. section 4D.
5.4 If necessary. the drawing parts can be requested by Production Engineering and created by
the PMA in advance ofthe kick-offmeeting.
5.5 When parts are entered per Workflow, the BOM Administrator enters the skeleton BOM
into Visibility~ and has it checked by Production Engineering.
5.6 After the checked skeleton BOM has been entered, Production Engineering and Scheduling
enter routers for drafting and shop work orders. Project Coordination adds top level
assemblies to the Sales Order and work orders are then created.
5.7 Pressure and mechanical components are added to the skeleton BOM (refer to 7.2).
5.8 As drawings are detailed by Drafting, raw material part numbers are searched for in the Part
Master. New raw material part numbers are created via coordination with the PMA.
5.9 Upon completion of the 2.3.4,5,6. 7, 8. 9. corresponding 20-series drawings, Parts List,
or revisions to any ofthese, the section leader submits a copy ofthe document to the BOM
Administrator for review.
5.9.1 The BOM Administrator should check the drawings for the following details.
The bill structure is correct and easy for interpreting bill levels
i
The correct units ofmeasure are being used
The drawing numbers match the skeleton bill structure
Other problems that may cause bill errors
5.9.2 The BOM Administrator coordinates with the section leader to correct any errors
found during the review.
5.9.3 The BOM Administrator issues the drawing to the PMA for part input. The copy
ofthe drawing should include any notes from the BOM Administrator to both the
PMA and document control concerning how the bill is to be entered.
5.9.4 After part number entry (refer to Part Number Assignment in Standards Book I.
section 4A). the PMA gives the drawing to Document Control.
5.9.5 Document Control enters the BOM and submits a print out with the drawing to
the BOM Administrator.

6.0 ACHE SKELETON HOM
6.1 The skeleton BOM consists ofall parts that match the scope ofwork for a project, known at
the outset ofthe project. This includes parts that will receive manufacturing and
engineering work orders linked together in a project hierarchy. It also includes other parts
known up front such as standard fan shaft, AV pipe support, nameplate, etc.
6.2 This step is the first bill input to Visibility~ and sets the project structure for the complete
BOM. The structure ofthe skeleton BOM may vary depending on the details ofthe
project, as determined at the kick-off meeting. It will follow the general guidelines
discussed for part numbers and descriptions in Bill ofMaterials Creation in Standards
Book I, section 3B.
6.3 The first step in creating a skeleton BOM is to layout the project structure on the Skeleton
BOM Request Form (refer to Skeleton BOM Request Form in Standards Book I, section
4D.
6.4 The PMA creates required parts for the assemblies and drawings listed on the Skeleton
BOM Request Form.
6.5 The BOM Administrator enters the skeleton BOM into Visibility~ per the request form, this
procedure, and the Visibility~ Engine.ering User Guide.
6.5.1 Create BOMs in the following order: any assembly with a drawing in its BOM,
6A's, 6A-3's, Unit parts, Bank parts, and Job part (refer to 6.6).
6.5.2 The indenture level on the Skeleton BOM Request Form can be used to determine
the location of each assembly and drawing in the BOM hierarchy.
6.6 Steps for entering a BOM (refer to the Visibility~ Engineering User Guide for more
information).
6.6.1 Log into the Visibility~, live database.
6.6.2 Type EN in the 'Action' field, then <ENTER>.
6.6.3 Type 10 to enter the Bills of Material menu, then <ENTER>.
6.6.4 Type 1 to select Bills of Material Maintenance, then <ENTER>.
6.6.5 In the 'Action:' field, type E to create a BOM for a part which doesn't already
have one, then <ENTER>.
6.6.6 In the 'Assembly Number:' field, either type in the part for which you are creating
a BOM or type "." to use the 'look-aside' screen to search the Part Master.
6.6.7 The BOM entry line consists ofthe following fields arranged in two lines as
shown:
Item, Component, Description, Level, Unit ofMeasure (UoM), Qty Per, Spares
Revised, Drawing Ref, Kit, Ph, Fx, Last Chg, Operation, Text
6.6.7.1 Item: a numeric sequential value which determines the order in which
the BOM components are displayed when printed or viewed on-line.

When entering, start with 10 and increment by 10. The 7A assembly
in the 6A-3 BOM should use 500 and al16A-3 components detailed on
the 7A drawing should follow, incrementing by 10. The 7A bolts
should start with number 1000.
6.6.7.2 Component: the part number for the components in the BOM. Enter
the part number or type to use the look-aside screen.
n.n
6.6.7.3 Description, Level, UoM: these fields are automatically filled-in once
the part number is entered. Check that the description agrees with the
part you thought you were entering. Level is NOT the same as
indenture level (refer to 3.2.5 and 6.9.7) in the indented BOM print­
out.
6.6.7.4 Qty Per: enter the amount ofthat component required to build one of
the part shown in the 'Assembly Number:' field. Quantity is in terms
ofthe UoM. Round all decimals to 3 digits.
6.6.7.5 Spares: press <ENTER> to use the default of zero.
6.6.7.6 Revised: this field is automatically left blank. the first time a BOM is
created. Thereafter, this field will show the date this item was added
to the BOM or last revised.
6.6.7.7 Drawing Ref, Kit: press <ENTER> in each ofthese fields to use the
defaults.
6.6.7.8 Ph: refers to the Phantom flag. Press <ENTER> to use the default
value (refer to 6.8 for phantom flag settings).
6.6.7.9 Fx: press <ENTER> in this field, unless the part entered is a drawing
or the testing spares assembly, in which case type Y, then <ENTER>.
This prevents the BOM quantity from 'rolling-up' with multiple
assemblies. Occasionally other parts will be 'fixed'. Production
Engineering will make that decision.
6.6.7.10 Last Chg, Operation, Text: press <ENTER> in these fields to use the
defaults.
6.6.8 After all items have been entered, type II, then <ENTER> in the next 'Item' field
to return to the 'Action:' field.
6.6.9 Type US, then <ENTER> to update the information and stay in this screen.
6.6.10 Ifmore than 7 components are used in the BOM, enter the first 7 parts per steps
6.6.1 through 6.6.9. From the 'Action:' field, type A and continue entering more
components per steps 6.6.5 through 6.6.10 until all components have been entered
(pay attention to the item numbers and make sure they are sequential and none are
duplicated).
6.7 Steps for editing an existing BOM.
6.7.1 From the 'Action:' field type F, then <ENTER>.

you are concerned with, then <ENTER>. Otherwise the cursor should move to
the 'Low-LvI' field. Proceed to 6.9.7.
6.9.7 Type the lowest level of parts you want to print. This level refers to the 'Level' of
a part that is determined by the system. Do no confuse this level with the
'Indenture Level' (refer to 3.2.5). This level is the lowest level that that part is
used anywhere in bills. If a component has a level of 04 and it is used on a bill
whose part is a level 05, the component's level will be changed to 06. Purchased
parts are almost always level 99. If you want all parts to be printed, press
<ENTER> in this field to use the default of 99.
6.9.8 In the 'Txt' field, type Y if you want BOM text to print or N if you don't want
BOM text to print, then <ENTER>.
6.9.9 The cursor should now be in the 'Type' field on the next line. You can now
request other reports by repeating steps 6.9.3 through 6.9.9 until all reports have
been requested. If you use up all 18 lines, the cursor will automatically return to
the 'Action:' field. If not, type II, then <ENTER>. Type DR, then <ENTER> to
save the information and exit the screen.

aid in searching for required parts.
ANGLE BUSHING FLG SCREW
BAR CHANNEL GRATING SHEET
BARSTOCK CONNECTOR PAINT TRANSITION
BEAM FENCE PIPE TUBE
BELT FINSTOCK PLATE TUBING
BOLT FINSTRIP PLUG WASHER
7.4 Create the detail drawings then add the parts from the drawings to the appropriate skeleton
bills (refer to 6.6 and 6.7).
7.4.1 As drawings are detailed and checked, but before releasing to the BaM
Administrator for review, search the Part Master for all raw material required
(refer to7.3).
7.4.2 Enter existing raw material part numbers on the drawings per the instructions for
that particular series ofdrawing.
7.4.3 All structural (i.e., non-header) plate will be called from the "RNDM" part
number for the appropriate thickness, with a UoM of square feet. Do not use parts
with actual plate dimensions (L x W).
7.4.4 The part number for standard structural bolts includes one nut. Washers,
however, are not included and will need to be listed separately.
7.4.5 If the raw material does not exist in the Part Master, coordinate with the PMA to
create the raw material part number (refer to Part Number Assignment in
Standards Book I, section 4A).
7.4.6 After the new part number has been added to the Part Master, you can use it on
the drawing.
7.4.7 Follow steps in paragraph 5.9 to enter ETa parts and all bills.

BILL OF MATERIALS CREATION
1.0 PURPOSE & INTRODUCTION
1.1 This procedure explains how the complete bill ofmaterials for an ACHE is structured.
1.2 It defines how to number and describe the skeleton level parts.
1.3 Part numbers will also be created and inserted into the indented BOM that represent work
performed in the Engineering department. These parts are not addressed in this document.
Refer to Engineering Part Number Management in Engineering Standards Book I, section
3C for information on how to handle these parts.
1.4 Occasionally, there will be projects that do not fit this standard bill format. When these
situations occur, Production Engineering will determine the bill and description formats.
1.5 In the following paragraphs HOOO is used as a generic project number and part numbers
contain the variable X in italic font. The actual project number should be used in place of
HOOO. A letter that uniquely identifies a particular assembly will replace the variable X.
This letter is not significant and does not necessarily correspond to any other assembly in
the indented BOM.
1.6 The Skeleton BOM - At the outset ofa project, an indented BOM, outlining the scope of
the project, is generated. This BOM is referred to as the Skeleton BOM. It consists only of
high level assemblies and is created so that work orders can be generated and scheduled
long before the drawings that detail the assemblies are created.
1.7 Completed BOM
1.7.1 After the assembly drawings are completed, the rest ofthe BOM is entered into
the various assemblies ofthe skeleton BOM. The different types ofparts that can
be added to the BOM at this point are purchased, standard, and ETO.
1.7.2 The Standards Department determines part numbers for Standard Parts.
1.7.3 Purchased parts are 5-digit, numeric part numbers determined by the PMA.
1.7.4 ETO part numbers are always in the form ofProject-Drawing-Piece mark. Refer
to ETO Descriptionsfor Parts and Assemblies, Standards Book I, section 4B for
description formats ofthese parts.
Example: HOOO-7X-l or HOOO-5X-A

6.3 Bill ofMaterials
6.3.1 The BaM for fan assemblies will be created and maintained by the HPC Fan
Engineering Department.
6.3.2 The BaM for all ACHE fan assemblies will consist of the hub and blades. AV
fans will also include a coupling, valve positioner, filter regulator, and other AV
hardware. 'AC?F' hubs will not include the coupling.
6.3.3 Components that are NOT included in this assembly are the bushing (for non­
tapered shafts), retainer plate assembly (for tapered shafts), and inlet bell sets.
These are added to the HOOO-I2XBOM.
6.3.4 Fans which are used on non-HPC ACHE applications are called out as Sales
Order line items by the Fan Sales Department. These fans use Features & Options
to select special parameters in the hubs, spools, or bushings; therefore the BOMs
for these fans do not have these components. These BOMs consist only ofblades,
seal discs, and seal disc hardware.
6.3.5 All fans will consist ofsomeorall ofthe following components: fan blades, seal
discs, seal disc hardware, hubs
6.3.6 When required, a modified seal disc is a manufactured part with the standard seal
disc in its BaM.
6.3.7 Seal disc hardware - Some seal discs include the mounting hardware as part of the
purchased part. For discs which do not, the hardware is included in a "HWKIT"
BaM. This kit part is included in the fan BaM.
6.3.8 Fan hubs are either AP or AV. These assemblies include (as required): the hub
body, spool, blade clamps, couplings, hardware, etc.
6.3.8.1 AP hubs are either cast or plate. The cast hub consists ofthe finished
hub (made from the purchased hub casting and the machining part) and
the blade retainer rings. The plate hub consists ofthe top and bottom
plates, spool, stop plate, blade clamps, blade arms (ifrequired), and
hardware. These hubs have full BOMs for AC fans, but for other fans,
the hub is compiled by Features & Options to handle parameters such
as coal tar coating, alloy hardware, special bores, etc.
6.3.8.2 AV hubs consist of the hub body, coupling, and all components in the
AV adjustment mechanism. This will include different range springs
for different blade angles or fan sizes.
6.4 New Fans
6.4.1 Fan Engineering will coordinate with the PMA to create new fans or revise
existing ones. They will do so per the structure of similarly configured fans, such
that the assembly hierarchy is maintained.

APPENDIX A: AMENDMENTS, revision 3.0
This appendix will list those changes to this procedure that occur between major revisions.
Therefore, this section may carry a different revision mark than the document itself. The
revision number for this appendix will start with the number ofthe document followed by a
decimal then the revision ofthe appendix. Upon receipt ofthis appendix, you should mark up
the main portion ofthe document with the corrections below so that you do not have to
constantly refer here for the most recent procedures.
This appendix is laid out with four columns. The first column gives the paragraph that is
being replaced, deleted, or added to the procedure. The second column describes how the
paragraph is being changed (R = replacing, A = adding, D = deleting). The third column
gives the revision number ofthe change. This column will help to track changes when a
paragraph has been revised more than once. The fourth column is the new or replaced
paragraph. If a paragraph has been deleted from the procedure, this fourth column will be
blank. If a paragraph has been deleted, the other paragraphs will NOT be renumbered. The
renumbering will take place on the next major revision to the entire document.
The most recent revisions will be in bold face type.

ENGINEERING - DRAWING PART NUMBER MANAGEMENT
1.0 PURPOSE & INTRODUCTION
1.1 Identify which drawing part numbers will be created and in which bills these part numbers
will reside.
1.2 Establish a description structure for each drawing part number.
1.3 Define how and when work orders for these part numbers will be created.
1.4 Establish the hierarchy of these work orders and the structure of their routers.
1.5 Define the meaning of operations.
1.6 Define time charging for work and move-tickets performed in HPC drafting and
engineering departments. Outline when move-tickets are performed and by whom, but not
how. Refer to Time & Attendance and Move Tickets and Salaried Timesheet Entry in
Standards Book I, sections 2A and 2B, respectively, for how to perform time charges and
move tickets.
1.7 This document requires prior knowledge of each drawing and other documents created and
maintained by the Engineering department.
1.8 Throughout this document the generic term #000 is used and is meant to refer to the
alphanumeric job number, with # representing the alphabet, e. g, job number HOOO, 1000,
and so on. Also throughout this document, D attached to the job number, i.e., D#OOO, is
meant to refer to the drawing part numbers, e.g. DHOOO-OA, DJOOO-OA, and so on.
1.9 The sections of this document only cover normal situations. Production Engineering may
deviate from this procedure taking into account the following considerations:
Drafting and/or Engineering is notified of the changes.
The two main purposes ofwork orders are to schedule engineering activities and to collect
and organize labor costs.
If a change becomes permanent, this procedure should be updated as soon as possible.
1.10 Appendix notations are reference with superscript numbers, e.g., 01501 Dwg to ... and
, 3,
so on.

4.4.3 Example:
a. Bank B includes: #OOO-C, #OOO-D
b. D#000-10BS is placed in #OOO-C when the skeleton bill is created.
c. The order of fabrication is: #OOO-D, #OOO-C
d. Move D#000-10BS to #OOO-D.
4.5 D#OOO-lOXF is placed in the BaM of#000-60X. Ifthe bank ships in multiple shipments,
place D#000-10XF in the BaM ofthe first #000-60Xto ship.
4.5.1 When the skeleton bill is created, it is placed in the first #000-60X, alphabetically.
4.5.2 After fabrication work orders are scheduled, it is moved to the correct BaM.
4.5.3 Example:
a. Bank B ships in two parts: #000-60C, #000-60D
b. D#000-10BF is placed in #000-60C when the skeleton bill is created.
c. The order of shipping is: #000-60D, #000-60C

4.11 D#000-H6X is placed in the BaM ofthe #OOO-IIX in which item X resides. Ifthe project
consists of only replacement bundles, this part is placed in #000.
4.12 Drawings sent to the customer at the beginning of a project are placed in the BaM ofthe
appropriate #OOO-IIX assembly. If the project consists of only replacement bundles, these
parts are placed in #000. This overrules any conflicting paragraphs in chapter 4.0.
4.12.1 These drawing part numbers include:
a. Header Drawings

8.0 WORK ORDERS
8.1 A work order identifies a task, such as the creation of a drawing or set of drawings.
8.2 A work order will be created for each and every drawing part number created.
8.3 Production Planning and Scheduling personnel (PP&S) create most ofthese work orders
when project work orders are created.
8.4 The following work orders are created by Production Engineering:
8.4.1 D#OOO-JOB work order is created immediately after the kickoff meeting
8.4.2 D#OOO-RT work order is created immediately after the kickoff meeting (if
required)
8.4.3 D#000-H6X work orders are created immediately after the kickoff meeting
8.4.4 Work orders for drawings sent to the customer at the start of a project. These
orders will be created soon after the kickoff meeting.
8.4.5 Work orders for some drawings nonnally created by PP&S.
a. Done on fast-track projects to expedite detailing when PP&S can't create orders
fast enough.
b. After PP&S creates work orders for the project, Production Engineering must
delete duplicated orders created by PP&S and link the expedited orders to the
correct fabricated work order.
8.4.6 Other work orders as required (including work orders for non-ACHE projects).
8.5 When PP&S reschedules the fabrication schedule for a project, the linked drawing work
orders are also rescheduled. However, the completion date for drawing Work Orders may
remain as is and therefore may fall after the Shop Kitup date. In these situations, 'HD'
should be added to line 10 in the Work Order Maintenance screen of Visibility. This will be
used by PP&S's scheduling program to 'hold' the schedule dates for the drafting work order.
9.0 DRAFTINGIENGINEERING ROUTERS FOR DRAWING PART NUMBERS
9.1 An operation is a step required to completing a task. A router is a sequence ofoperations
required to complete a work order.

4.0 ENGINEERING ROUTERS FOR ENGINEERING PART NUMBERS
4.1 An operation is a step required to completing a task. A router is a sequence ofoperations
required to complete a work order.
4.2 Appendix A lists the complete routers used on engineering work orders.
4.2.1 Documents created by HPM.
4.2.2 Each table lists (from left to right) the following information:
• Operation number
• Description ofthe operation
• Person responsible for performing the move ticket on that operation
• When the move ticket is to be performed
4.3 The scope ofwork for an operation is dependent upon the operation description. An
attempt is made to keep operation numbers consistent for each operation description.
However, sometimes this can not be done. Care should be taken to follow the operation
description.
5.0 OPERATION SCOPE OF WORK
5.1 LAYOUT
• This covers the creation ofinformal layouts, ifrequired, that facilitate the detailing of
the assembly components.
• It includes the checking and scrubbing ofthose layouts, ifrequired.
5.2 HPMREV-X
• Revisions performed by HPM personnel after a document has been issued as complete.
• X indicates the type oftask being revised. (as listed in table 1)

6.0 REVISIONS
6.1 There are many different types ofrevisions that can be handled in a number ofways. The
manner in which a particular revision is handled directly affects how time charges and
move tickets are done. The following are guidelines for how to handle revisions.
Production Engineering and the Drafting Supervisor will make the final decision on a case­
by-case basis.
6.2 In these instructions, the cause ofthe revision does not matter. These instructions will hold
whether the revision is a customer revision or a detailing error.
6.3 Types ofrevisions
6.3.1 Revisions to Assemblies Before Detailing Starts
6.3.2 Design Change Before Initial Issue
6.3.3 Changes After Drawing Has Been Issued
6.3.4 Approval Drawing Mark-Ups
6.4 A revision that comes prior to the start ofdetailing will not affect the work orders. Simply
start the drawing, charging time and doing move tickets normally, with the latest design.
6.5 Refer to the chapter on 'Operation Scope ofWork' above for where to charge time for
revisions that occur before and after the first issue (including approval mark-ups).
6.6 When a revision is required, Production Engineering and the Drafting Supervisor should be
notified. They should be made aware ofthe exact nature and scope ofthe change. RPM
Engineering and Drafting should charge their time on the proper 'REVISION'-operation.

DESCRIPTIONS OF ENGINEER-TO-ORDER PARTS
1.0 PURPOSE
1.1 This document defines the description structure for ETO parts that will receive a part
number. These descriptions will be shown on the drawing BOM and in Visibility for each
part number.
1.2 ETO parts are separated into two types of parts, each with its own description format.
1.2.1 Assemblies and Non-Welded Components
1.2.2 Welded Components
1.3 ETO descriptions are to be maintained by the PMA. The Standards Department and
Production Engineering will maintain this procedure.
1.4 This procedure does NOT cover descriptions for the following part numbers.
1.4.1 Skeleton BOM parts, discussed in Bill ofMaterials Creation in Standards Book 1,
section 3B.
1.4.2 Purchased parts, which are maintained by the PMA
1.4.3 Standard parts, which are maintained by the Standards Department

3.2 This procedure is the primary source for ETO descriptions. The descriptions shown on
reference drawings and in other procedures and work instructions are NOT necessarily up­
to-date. In cases of conflict, the descriptions in this procedure will take precedence.
4.0 DESCRIPTION TABLES FOR COMMON ETO PARTS AND ASSEMBLIES
4.1 The tables are configured per drawing series.
4.2 Italic text in the tables references infonnation required when a description is entered. This
infonnation may vary from part to part. The rest of the description is entered as shown.
4.3 All dimensions should be shown in fractional fonn.
4.4 All lengths should be shown in feet and inches and all other dimensions in inches. Include
a foot symbol but not an inch symbol.
4.5 Material thickness (only for pressed channel tube spacers) is shown in fractional inches
unless a gauge material is used.
4.6 Length and width dimensions offonned objects (i.e., bent, rolled, pressed, etc.) should be
shown as pre-fonned dimensions. This gives the actual lengths and widths required to start
fabrication.
4.7 All other dimensions (except for the pressed channel tube spacers) should be shown in the
detail.
4.8 Assemblies and Non-Welded Components
4.8.1 Assemblies are objects composed of two or more components that are joined
together.
4.8.2 Non-welded components are objects composed only of the raw material and are
bolted to other objects to fonn assemblies. These components can also be placed
into other assemblies without being bolted or welded.
4.8.3 The following welded components will be treated like non-welded components
for description purposes.
a. Side air seals that are tack welded to the side channel of the frame
b. Plate components that make up or are welded to the header box
c. Stiffeners in nozzles
4.8.4 Descriptions for non-welded components made from plate or sheet (or other
material stocked in units of square feet), should also include ",width x length" at
the end of the description listed.
4.8.5 Descriptions for assemblies, non-welded components, and the welded component
exceptions listed above can be found in the following tables.

3.7 After the PMA is finished entering all ofthe parts, enter the single-level bills into
Visibility~. Refer to the Visibility~, Engineering User Guide for instructions on performing
this task.
3.8 Submit a printout ofthe BOM from Visibility~ along with the checked copy of the Skeleton
BOM Request Form to the Production Engineer who checked the request form originally.
3.9 The Production Engineer checks the bill for input of bill structure, including quantity, and
for part description input.
4.0 SKELETON HOM REQUEST FORM TEMPLATE
4.1 You will need to copy the file, Master2.dot from the server to your local hard drive.
4.1.1 On the server, this file is located at the following location:
Q:\HPC_CAD_SERVER\STANDARDS & PROCEDURES\Standards Book l\Section 4
4.1.2 It should be copied to the following location in your hard drive:
C:\MSOffice\Templates
4.1.3 This file is updated and kept current by the BOM Administrator. This could
change periodically. Since the BOM Administrator is the only one who uses this
template, the most current copy should always be used. The BOM Administrator
must make sure this file is kept current as skeleton bill structures change.
4.2 Launch the MS Word~ application.
4.3 From the File menu, select 'New'.

4.4 Choose the template, 'Master2'.
4.5 Review the forms listed in 3.1 and determine the quantity of banks, ACHEs, bundles, etc.
required for the job.
4.6 Use the copy and paste functions in Word~ to duplicate as many banks, ACHEs ,etc.
required.
4.7 Please keep in mind that all Banks, ACHEs, etc. should have sequential lettering (i.e.
H545-11A, H545-11B, etc.).
4.7.1 Occasionally, you will come across some jobs in which you might have to get out
of sequence.
4.7.2 The BOM Administrator and Production Engineering will have to make the
determination when to deviate from sequential lettering on assemblies.
4.8 Ifa unit is induced draft, delete H###-5?? and DH###-5?? from the skeleton for that unit.
4.9 The skeleton bill template includes both standard and non-standard shafts.
4.9.1 Ifa unit is induced draft or has non-standard forced draft fan shafts, remove the
standard shaft (pin 04A01) from the skeleton for that unit.
4.9.2 Ifa unit is forced draft with a standard shaft, remove both H###-l01??-1 and
DH###-101A from the skeleton bill for that unit.
4.9.3 Ifa unit is forced draft with non-standard fan shafts, add H###-102??-1 And
DH###-102A in place ofH###-lOl??-1 and DH###-10IA.
4.10 Continue to remove any assemblies and drawings that the FFSS show as not being part of
HPC's scope ofsupply.
4.11 Next use the find and replace functions in Word~ to fill in the complete descriptions and
part numbers for each assembly and drawing. Please refer to the appendix for an
explanation ofeach symbol and what it refers to.
4.12 You will need to use the FFSS to aid you in developing descriptions.
4.13 Once the descriptions have been completed, proceed to enter the correct quantities required
for each assembly, drawing, etc.
4.14 You must also designate any parts that are to be placed on the sal~s order. Do this by
typing 'SO' at the far right side of the line that corresponds to the sales line item part
number.
4.15 For any part that should already be in the Parts Master when it is time to enter, assuming
the PMA goes through the list from top to bottom, type an asterisk (*) to the right of the
parts quantity, or 'SO'.
4.16 Any assembly that is to be manufactured by an outside vendor, should have BUY entered
to the right ofthe quantity onthe line corresponding to the assembly. Ifthe assembly has a
drawing part number associated with it, move the part number up one level in the skeleton
bill.

B DRAFTING SCHEDULE GANTT CHART & HEADER DESIGN SCHEDULE
Purpose & Introduction
This automation routine utilizes Impromptu to extract data from Visibility and organize that data, by
drawing, in a schedule format. The routine then imports the Impromptu output (through MS Excel)
into MS Project and organizes the schedule in chronological order. It requires minimal input by the
user.
Instructions for Use
Running the Impromptu Macro:
1. If the shortcut for the macro has been installed on your desktop, double-click the 'sched.mac'
shortcut. Then proceed to step 2. Otherwise, skip steps 1 through 3 and proceed to step 4.
2. Press the 'F5' key and then skip to step 5.
3. This macro will do the following:
3.1. run all necessary Impromptu reports
3.2. create the appropriate MS Excel file (wl1.xls)
3.3. run and print the Header Design Schedule to the default printer
3.4. close Impromptu
3.5. launch MS Project
4. You can also run the macro from within Impromptu by selecting 'Macro...', from the 'Tools'
menu. Then select the file, 'sched.mac' (extension may not appear depending on your
computer's configuration), in the following directory:
c:\Cognos\Bi97\User Workspace\Drafting Schedule\
Finish this method by selecting the 'Run' button.
5. Retrieve the Header Design Schedule from the default printer for your Pc.
Updating the MS Project File:
1. The Microsoft Project file, Drafting Schedule.mpp, is on the server and is available for anyone
to access at any time. This file must not be open on anyone's PC or this program will not work
properly. You may want to open the file first. If you get any 'read-only' notices, the file is
open on someone's Pc. Otherwise, close the file and proceed with the next step.
2. IfMS Project is running from the server on your PC, open the file,
n:\TRANSFERFOLDER\Drafting\Schedule\Schedule Macro.mpp. Otherwise, skip this and
the next two steps then proceed to step 5.
3. Microsoft Project will warn you that the file contains macros. Select the 'Enable Macros'
button.
4. Type 'Ctrl-T'. Skip step 5 and proceed to step 6.
5. Type 'Ctrl-Q'.
6. You will receive the following warning message:
The selection is too large.
Microsoft Project may not be able to undo changes made to such a large selection.
Do you want to continue anyway?
7. Select the 'Yes' button or press [Enter].

C COST & WEIGHT CALCULATION AND ENTRY
Purpose & Introduction
The purpose ofthis program is to quickly calculate the weights and costs of sub-contracted structural
assemblies and enter those values into Visibility.
Instructions For Use
1 There are some things that must be done and information that must be gathered prior to
executing the script.
1.1 All parts, assembly and components, need to be entered into Visibility with the proper
settings. Some ofthe more important settings are:
1.1.1 Make / Buy flag
1.1.2 Phantom flag
1.1.3 Engineering Category
1.2 The complete bills ofmaterials should be entered and checked first.
1.3 Ifthe vendor is anyone other than RPM, the file
'n:\TRANSFERFOLDER\Drafting\Sublets\Outside Sublet Pricing.xIs needs to be set up
with the project and proper costs. The data for the project that is the focus ofthe current
run should be in column 3 ofthe appropriate worksheet. Production Engineering should
enter the prices into this file.
1.4 You will need the part number of the assembly for which component assemblies will be
sub-contracted.
1.5 You will need to know whether or not there are revised cost records for the sub-contracted
assemblies. Either all must have them or all must not have them. Ifsome, but not all have
them, you will need to create the revised cost records, manually, for those that don't. To
check for these records, follow these steps from the main menu in Visibility:
1.5.1 Type PC and <ENTER>
1.5.2 Type 03 and <ENTER>
1.5.3 Type F and <ENTER>
1.5.4 Type the part number of the assembly, followed by @ and <ENTER>.
1.5.5 Press <ENTER> several times. If only the assembly part number appears, then
none of the parts have revised cost records. Otherwise, at least some have them
(check that all do).
1.6 You will need to know the name of the vendor.
1.7 If the vendor is RPM, you will need to know ifthe assemblies are to be galvanized or
painted.
2 Position the cursor, in Visibility, in the 'Selection:' field in the 'Main Menu'.
3 If an icon has been set up in your copy of Reflections, select with the mouse. Ifnot, select Run
Script from the Script menu in Reflections.
4 Select the script file WCEntryU.rbs or WCEntryA.rbs, depending on your particular setup (the
extension' .rbs' may not appear, depending on your PC's settings).
5 Select the Run button.
6 Follow the instructions in the various dialogue boxes that will appear.
6.1 This program performs three different tasks.
6.1.1 Calculate and enter the weights of sub-contracted assembly components.

6.1.2 Calculate and enter the weights of sub-contracted assemblies.
6.1.3 Calculate and enter the costs of sub-contracted assemblies.
6.2 The program will need to be run three times for each assembly in the following order. If
this order is not followed, the final costs will not be correct.
6.2.1 Weights - for components
6.2.2 Weights - for assemblies
6.2.3 Costs
6.3 When entering the part number for the assembly, be sure to use all capital letters.
Visibility Screen Access Required
You are required to have access to the following screens and processes in order to run this report.

Program Installation
Impromptu User Version Installation
1 Copy the following files to the directory c:\Cognos\Bi97\User Workspace\Sublets\ on the user's
PC.
n:\TRANSFERFOLDER\Drafting\Sublets\CostData.imr
n:\TRANSFERFOLDER\Drafting\Sublets\CompWght.imr
n:\TRANSFERFOLDER\Drafting\Sublets\AssyWght.imr
2 Copy the following file to the default, script directory on the user's Pc.
n:\TRANSFERFOLDER\Drafting\Sublets\WCEntry.rbs
3 Change the name ofWCEntry.rbs to WCEntryU.rbs.
4 Launch the Impromptu application.
5 Open the report, CostData.imr from the user's PC (not the server copy).
6 Log-in to the catalog when prompted.
7 The system wants you to copy the catalog to the local hard drive. If the catalog
'Engineering-General' already exists on the user's PC, save the catalog as 'Temporary.cat' to
the default directory, for that PC. Otherwise, save it as 'Engineering-General' in the
directory, c:\Cognos\Bi97\User Workspace\Sublets\.
8 Link the report to the 'Engineering-General' catalog on the user's PC (note the directory as it
will be used later when modifying the script).
9 Save and close the report. Then close the catalog.
10 Open that same report again (the system will notify you that it will reestablish links to the
new catalog), press OK, save the report and then close it (leaving the PC version of the
catalog open).
11 Open the report, CompWght.imr from the user's PC (not the server copy).
12 Save the report and close it (leaving the PC version of the catalog open).
13 Repeat steps 11 and 12 for the report, AssyWghtimr.
14 Close the 'Engineering-General' catalog.
15 Open each of these reports again to ensure the new links were established. Be sure to close
the catalog before opening & testing each report.
16 Close Impromptu.

D ETO PART ENTRY
Purpose & Introduction
This program is designed to enter part numbers into Visibility from a Microsoft Excel template. It
allows the PMA to use some ofthe features ofExcel to build part numbers and descriptions quickly. It
also removes a lot ofthe redundancy in data entry from part number to part number (i.e., various flags)
and removes the error associated with choosing the wrong hot key. While the program can be used for a
variety ofparts, it was designed to be used to enter ETa, manufactured parts (this includes sub­
contracted parts). Using it to enter any other parts may result in errors with running the program or with
the data entered.
Instructions for Use
1 Open MS Excel.
2 From the 'File' menu, select 'New...'.
3 On the 'General' tab, select the template, 'Part Entry', then the 'OK' button.
4 Enter the following data for each part you wish to enter into Visibility. You can use features ofMS
Excel to speed up the input ofthis data (e.g., 'AutoFill', 'Cut-and-Paste', etc.).
4.1 All data entered must be in capital letters. You should press the 'Caps Lock' key before
starting.
4.2 The cursor should be in cell 'A6' ofworksheet 'ETa-Make' when the workbook is started.
4.3 Enter the project number in column A.
4.4 Enter the drawing number in column B.
4.5 Enter the piece mark ofthe part to be entered in column C.
4.6 Enter the start ofthe description into column D, per ETO Part Description Formats in
Engineering Standards Book I, section 4B.
A list ofthese 'Description Nouns' can be found in the worksheet 'Description Lists' in
the active Excel workbook. This list should be maintained by the Standards department.
However, due to the logistics ofupdating the Excel template, it may lag behind the
procedure. This list is intended to be used as an aid to part description look-up. The
standards book will always supercede the list in the Excel template.
4.7 Ifthe description is required to show the width ofthe raw material, enter the elements ofthat
dimension as follows.
4.7.1 inches in column E
4.7.2 numerator ofthe inch fraction (ifany) in column F
4.7.3 denominator ofthe inch fraction (if any) in column G
4.8 Ifthe description is required to show the length ofthe raw material, enter the elements ofthat
dimension as follows.
4.8.1 feet in column H (if less then 1 foot, enter 0)
4.8.2 inches in column I (ifzero inches, enter 0)
4.8.3 numerator ofthe inch fraction (ifany) in column J
4.8.4 denominator ofthe inch fraction (if any) in column K
4.9 Enter the data for the next part into the next row, starting with column A. Remember that
Excel has several tools available to copy data. This is very helpful when entering the project,
drawing number, description noun, etc.
4.10 Enter the number ofthe last Excel row that contains a part number to be entered in cell 'B5'.

4.11 If you are entering part numbers ofassemblies that will be purchased from vendors, you can
switch to the worksheet 'ETO-Sub' at this time.
4.12 Enter these other parts in a similar manner to the 'ETO-Make' parts. The only parts that
should be entered on this worksheet should be the actual part numbers that will appear on the
purchase order and be received either at the HPC-Beasley facility, the job site, or some other
staging location. The difference in procedure for 'ETO-Sub' parts is as follows.
4.12.1 After entering all dimension information (ifrequired), enter the buyer code into
column L.
4.12.2 Enter the cost type ofthe part into column M.
4.12.3 Enter the engineering category into column N.
4.13 Review the description character sets (columns S, U, and W for the 'ETO-Make' worksheet,
and columns U, W, and Y for the 'ETO-Sub' worksheet).
4.13.1 Review the numbers in columns T, V, and X ofworksheet 'ETO-Make' and columns
V, X, and Z ofworksheet 'ETO-Sub'.
4.13.2 These numbers are a count ofthe number ofcharacters in the cell to the left ofthat
column. This number should never exceed 30.
4.13.3 The worksheets are set up so that ifthe first set ofcharacters (columns S for 'make'
parts and U for 'sub' parts) exceeds 30, the description will be broken up between this
first set and the second set (columns U for 'make' parts and W for 'sub' parts).
4.13.4 Ifthe third set ofcharacters (columns W for 'make' parts and Y for 'sub' parts) is
needed or ifthe program doesn't break up the descriptions properly, you will have to
enter the description into the 3 columns manually. Take care not to allow any set of
characters to exceed 30.
5 From the 'File' menu, select 'Save As...' and save the file as 'c:\My Documents\Part Entry.xIs,. If
entering a large number ofparts, you may want to save often, during step 4.
6 Select the worksheet 'ETO-Make'.
7 Using the mouse, select all cells starting from row 6 through the row after the last row in which data
has been entered. You will need to include columns R, S, T, U, V, W, and X in the selection area.
8 From the 'File' menu, select 'Print Area ~ Set Print Area'.
9 Repeat steps 7 and 8 for the worksheet 'ETO-Sub', ifany parts were entered there, with the
exception that columns T, U, V, W, X, Y, and Z should be included in the selection area.
10 Select the printer icon from within each worksheet. This will print your selected print area. If
nothing was entered into 'ETO-Sub', do not select the printer icon from within that worksheet.
11 Submit the printout, with drawings, for checking.
12 After receiving the marked-up copy ofthe printout, make all necessary corrections.
13 Save the file using the save icon.
14 Close MS Excel.
15 Log into Visibility and move the cursor in Visibility to the 'Selection:' field in the 'Main Menu'.
16 From the 'Scril!t' menu, select 'Run Script...'.
17 Select the script 'Part Entry' from within the default Reflection script director on your PC. Then
select the 'Run' button.
18 If the program hangs, encounters any errors during execution, or starts beeping rapidly (but not
necessarily continuously) while entering no data, see the program administrator immediately.
19 The script should leave the cursor back in the 'Selection:' field ofthe 'Main Menu'.
20 When the program has finished, delete the file 'c:\My Documents\Part Entry.xls'. This will help to
avoid your accidentally trying to enter parts more than once.

SUbject: RE: Zinc metallize weights per tube
New rule for zinc metalized tUbe ends: For jobs that require zinc metalized tUbe ends, Production Engineering (Steve and
Jonathan) will add the quantity of zinc to the 6A-4 EBOM when the skeleton BaM is first created, same as has been done
to date. The quantity of zinc will be 0.045 Ibs per tube, regardless of tube diameter. This supercedes the old rule of 0.025
Ibs per tube per inch of diameter, which superceded 0.09 Ibs per tube per inch of diameter.
This will need to be updated in our standards books.

SUbject: Zinc metallize weights per tube
Per discussion with Finning shop personnel, pis use .045#, per tube to calculate zinc required. This is the same for all
diameters of tubes
